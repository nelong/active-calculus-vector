<div class="para">Most polar graphing devices can plot curves in polar coordinates of the form <span class="process-math">\(r = f(\theta)\text{.}\)</span> Use such a device to complete this activity.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Before plotting the polar curve <span class="process-math">\(r=1\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> can have any value), think about what shape it should have, in light of how <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> is connected to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> Then use appropriate technology to draw the graph and test your intuition.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The equation <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 1\)</span> does not define <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> so we canâ€™t graph this equation on many polar plotters. What do you think the graph of the polar curve <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 1\)</span> looks like? Why?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Before plotting the polar curve <span class="process-math">\(r = \theta\text{,}\)</span> what do you think the graph looks like? Why? Use technology to plot the curve and compare your intuition.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What does the region defined by <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq r \leq 3\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> can have any value) look like? (Hint: Compare to your response from part (a).)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">What does the region defined by <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq r \leq 3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\pi/4 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2\)</span> look like?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Consider the curve <span class="process-math">\(r = \sin(\theta)\text{.}\)</span> For some values of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> we will have <span class="process-math">\(r \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> In these situations, we plot the point <span class="process-math">\((r,\theta)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\((|r|, \theta+\pi)\)</span> (in other words, when <span class="process-math">\(r \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> we reflect the point through the origin). With that in mind, what do you think the graph of <span class="process-math">\(r = \sin(\theta)\)</span> looks like? Plot this curve using technology and compare to your intuition.</div></li>
