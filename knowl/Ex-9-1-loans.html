<div class="para">When people buy a large ticket item like a car or a house, they often take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the borrower has to make depends on the amount <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> of money borrowed (called the principal), the duration <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> of the loan in years, and the interest rate <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
M(r,t) = \frac{1500r}{1-\frac{1}{\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}}.
