<p>The temperature on an unevenly heated metal plate positioned in the first quadrant of the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C(x,y) = \frac{25xy+25}{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + 1}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Assume that temperature is measured in degrees Celsius and that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are each measured in inches. (<em class="emphasis">Note:</em> At no point in the following questions should you expand the denominator of <span class="process-math">\(C(x,y)\text{.}\)</span>)</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Determine <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial C}{\partial x}|_{(x,y)}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\partial C}{\partial y}|_{(x,y)}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If an ant is on the metal plate, standing at the point <span class="process-math">\((2,3)\text{,}\)</span> and starts walking in the direction parallel to the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> axis, at what rate will the temperature the ant is experiencing change?  Explain, and include appropriate units.</p></li>
<li><p>If an ant is walking along the line <span class="process-math">\(y = 3\)</span> in the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction, at what instantaneous rate will the temperature the ant is experiencing change when the ant passes the point <span class="process-math">\((1,3)\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose the ant is stationed at the point <span class="process-math">\((6,3)\)</span> and walks in a straight line towards the point <span class="process-math">\((2,0)\text{.}\)</span>  Determine the <em class="emphasis">average</em> rate of change in temperature (per unit distance traveled) the ant encounters in moving between these two points.  Explain your reasoning carefully.  What are the units on your answer?</p></li>
