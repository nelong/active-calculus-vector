<p>The temperature on a heated metal plate positioned in the first quadrant of the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C(x,y) = 25e^{-(x-1)^2 - (y-1)^3}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Assume that temperature is measured in degrees Celsius and that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are each measured in inches.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Determine <span class="process-math">\(C_{xx}(x,y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_{yy}(x,y)\text{.}\)</span>  Do not do any additional work to algebraically simplify your results.</p></li>
