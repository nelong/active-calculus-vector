<p>In the following questions, we apply the Chain Rule in several different contexts.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Suppose that we have a function <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(z(x,y) = x^2+xy^3\text{.}\)</span>  In addition, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are restricted to points that move around the plane by following a circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> centered at the origin that is parameterized by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x(t) = 2\cos(t),
\ 
\mbox{and } 
\ 
y(t) = 2\sin(t).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Use the Chain Rule to find the resulting instantaneous rate of change <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dz}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Substitute <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the rule for <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> to write <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and calculate <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dz}{dt}\)</span> directly. Compare to the result of part (i.).</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppose that the temperature on a metal plate is given by the function <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> with</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T(x,y) = 100-(x^2 + 4y^2),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are each measured in feet.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Find <span class="process-math">\(T_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T_y\text{.}\)</span>  What are the units on these partial derivatives?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose an ant is walking along the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis at the rate of 2 feet per minute toward the origin.  When the ant is at the point <span class="process-math">\((2,0)\text{,}\)</span> what is the instantaneous rate of change in the temperature <span class="process-math">\(dT/dt\)</span> that the ant experiences.  Include units on your response.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose instead that the ant walks along an ellipse with <span class="process-math">\(x = 6\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = 3\sin(t)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in minutes.  Find <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dT}{dt}\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(t = \pi/6\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(t=\pi/4\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t = \pi/3\text{.}\)</span>  What does this seem to tell you about the path along which the ant is walking?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Suppose that you are walking along a surface whose elevation is given by a function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>  Furthermore, suppose that if you consider how your location corresponds to points in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane, you know that when you pass the point <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\text{,}\)</span> your velocity vector is <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\langle -1,2\rangle\text{.}\)</span>  If some contours of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_10_5_contour.html" title="Figure 10.5.2">FigureÂ 10.5.2</a>, estimate the rate of change <span class="process-math">\(df/dt\)</span> when you pass through <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\text{.}\)</span> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 25%; margin-right: 25%;"><img src="external/images/fig_10_3_activity_contour.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
