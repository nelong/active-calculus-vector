<p>Let's consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> defined by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/F_10_6_preview_1.html">
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = 30 - x^2 - \frac 12 y^2,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> measures the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at a given point in the plane, where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are measured in feet. Assume that the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis points due east, while the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis points due north. A contour plot of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_10_6_preview_1.html" title="Figure 10.6.1">FigureÂ 10.6.1</a></p>

<li><p>Suppose that a person is walking due east, and thus parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.  At what instantaneous rate is the temperature changing with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> at the moment the walker passes the point <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\text{?}\)</span>  What are the units on this rate of change?</p></li>
<li><p>Next, determine the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to distance at the point <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\)</span> if the person is instead walking due north.  Again, include units on your result.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, rather than walking due east or due north, let's suppose that the person is walking with velocity given by the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle\text{,}\)</span> where time is measured in seconds.  Note that the person's speed is thus <span class="process-math">\(| \vv | = 5\)</span> feet per second. Find parametric equations for the person's path; that is, parameterize the line through <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\)</span> using the direction vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv = \langle 3, 4 \rangle\text{.}\)</span>  Let <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> denote the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the line, and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\)</span> its <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-coordinate. Make sure your parameterization places the walker at the point <span class="process-math">\((2,1)\)</span> when <span class="process-math">\(t=0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>With the parameterization in (c), we can now view the temperature <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as not only a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> but also of time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>  Hence, use the chain rule to determine the value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{df}{dt}\bigm|_{t=0}\text{.}\)</span>  What are the units on your answer?  What is the practical meaning of this result?</p></li>
