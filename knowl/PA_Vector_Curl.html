<div class="introduction">
<div class="para">We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of spinner we imagine is illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_Curl_Spinner.html" title="Figure 12.7.3">Figure 12.7.3</a>. It consists of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner’s paddle. In this activity, we will be trying to assess how the the spinner will rotate around the black axel (as an axis of rotation).</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><iframe id="sage_spinner_interact1" width="600" height="600" src="sage_spinner_interact1-if.html"></iframe><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">12.7.3<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>A paddle-bladed spinner</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_Curl_PA_0x.html" title="Figure 12.7.4">Figure 12.7.4</a>. As you think about these questions, draw an “X” at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 75%; margin-left: 12.5%; margin-right: 12.5%;"><img src="generated/sageplot/img_Curl_0x_field.svg" role="img" class="contained" alt="A vector field that has only nonzero vertical component that is upward and increasing as you move horizontally to the right and downward as you move to the left."></div>

<div class="para">Draw an X at the origin to act as your spinner. Draw a vector on the top right blade of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade. Next, draw a vector on each of the other blades of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at the origin would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Now we would like to look at the rotational strength of <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> at the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{.}\)</span> As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade. It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.</div></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<div class="para">Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.
