<div class="introduction">
<p>In this preview activity, we will look at several two-dimensional vector fields and try to assess when the vector field has increased or decreased in strength over a given region. We begin with graphs of the three vector fields. Parts <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task_PA_Vector_Div_InOut.html" title="Task 12.6.1.a">a</a>, <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task_PA_Vector_Div_CreateDestroy.html" title="Task 12.6.1.b">b</a>, and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task_PA_Vector_Div_Smaller.html" title="Task 12.6.1.c">c</a> ask you to answer the same three questions about the vector field and square illustrated in each of the figures. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task_PA_Vector_Div_P4P5P6.html" title="Task 12.6.1.d">Part d</a> asks you to think further about the third vector field.</p>
