<div class="introduction"><p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals_DifferentPaths.html" title="Activity 12.3.3">Activity 12.3.3</a>, we considered the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF(x,y) = \langle
y^2,2xy+3\rangle\)</span> and two different oriented curves from <span class="process-math">\((1,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((-1,0)\text{.}\)</span> We found that the value of the line integral of <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> was the same along those two oriented curves.</p></div>

<p>Verify that <span class="process-math">\(\vF(x,y) = \langle y^2,2xy+3\rangle\)</span> is a gradient vector field by showing that <span class="process-math">\(\vF = \nabla f\)</span> for the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = xy^2 + 3y\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>Calculate the change in the output of the scalar function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> over the curves <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\text{.}\)</span> In other words, what is the difference in the output of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at the start of the curve and the end of the curve. How does this value compare to the value of the line integral <span class="process-math">\(\int_{C_1}\vF\cdot d\vr\)</span> you found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals_DifferentPaths.html" title="Activity 12.3.3">Activity 12.3.3</a>?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(C_3\)</span> be the line segment from <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((3,4)\text{.}\)</span> Calculate <span class="process-math">\(\int_{C_3}\vF\cdot d\vr\)</span> as well as <span class="process-math">\(f(3,4)-f(1,1)\text{.}\)</span> What do you notice?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>Earlier in the chapter, we've used <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Clairaut.html" title="Assemblage: Clairaut's Theorem">Clairaut's Theorem</a> to argue that a vector field in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is not a gradient vector field when <span class="process-math">\(\partial F_1/\partial y\neq \partial F_2/\partial
x\text{.}\)</span> Earlier in this preview activity, you verified that a given vector field was the gradient of a particular function of two variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of three variables. However, in that case there are six mixed partials to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious.The remaining parts of this preview activity suggest a process for determining if a vector field in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> is a gradient vector field as well as finding a potential function for the vector field.</p>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(\vG(x,y,z) = \langle 3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x),6xy e^{y^2} -
z,3z^2-y-\cos(x)\rangle\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vH(x,y,z) = \langle 3x^2
y,x^3+2yz^3,xz+3y^2z^2\rangle\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(\vG\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vH\)</span> are to be gradient vector fields, then there are functions <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(\vG = \nabla g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vH=\nabla h\text{.}\)</span> What would this tell us about the partial derivatives <span class="process-math">\(g_x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g_y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g_z\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(h_x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(h_y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h_z\text{?}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(g_1(x,y,z)=3e^{y^2}+xyz-z\sin(x)\text{.}\)</span> Calculate <span class="process-math">\(\partial g_1/\partial x\text{.}\)</span> Could <span class="process-math">\(g_1\)</span> be a potential function for the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vG\text{?}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<p>Find a function <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\partial g/\partial x =
3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x)\text{.}\)</span>  Find a function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\partial h/\partial x = 3x^2y\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(g)</span></h4>
<div class="introduction"><p>When finding the most general anti-derivative for a function of one variable, we add a constant of integration (usually denoted by <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span>) to capture the fact that any constant will become <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> through differentiation.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(i)</span></h5>
<p>When taking the partial derivative with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> of a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> what variables can appear in terms that become <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the partial derivative because they are treated as constants?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(ii)</span></h5>
<p>What does this tell you should be added to <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in the previous part to make them the most general possible functions with the desired partial derivatives with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{?}\)</span></p></article></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(h)</span></h4>
<p>Now calculate <span class="process-math">\(\partial g/\partial y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\partial
h/\partial y\text{.}\)</span> Explain why this tells you that we must have</p>

<p>Calculate <span class="process-math">\(\partial g/\partial z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\partial

Notice that <span class="process-math">\(m_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_2\)</span> are functions of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> alone, so taking a partial derivative with respect to <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is the same as taking an ordinary derivative, and thus you may use the notation <span class="process-math">\(m'_1(z)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m'_2(z)\text{.}\)</span></p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(j)</span></h4>
