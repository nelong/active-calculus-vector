<div class="para">Earlier in the chapter, we've used <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Clairaut.html" title="Assemblage: Clairaut's Theorem">Clairaut's Theorem</a> to argue that a vector field in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is not a gradient vector field when <span class="process-math">\(\partial F_1/\partial y\neq \partial F_2/\partial
x\text{.}\)</span> Earlier in this preview activity, you verified that a given vector field was the gradient of a particular function of two variables. Clairaut's Theorem holds for functions of three variables. However, in that case there are six mixed partials to calculate, and thus it can be rather tedious.The remaining parts of this preview activity suggest a process for determining if a vector field in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> is a gradient vector field as well as finding a potential function for the vector field.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\vG(x,y,z) = \langle 3e^{y^2}+z\sin(x),6xy e^{y^2} -
