<div class="introduction"><p>Recall from <a href="S-9-3-Dot-Product.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.3: The Dot Product">Section 9.3</a> that the work done by a force <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> on an object that moves with displacement vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\vF\cdot \vv\text{.}\)</span> In this Preview Activity, we consider the work done by wind on a helicopter at various stages of its journey.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h4>
<p>Our intrepid pilot flies for some time and finds that they are <span class="quantity">30 km</span> from where they started at a heading of <span class="quantity">20 °</span> degrees east of due north. During this portion of the trip, the wind is exerting a force on the helicopter of <span class="quantity">100 </span> in the due east direction. Find the work the wind has done on the helicopter during the flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h4>
<p>Our pilot sees a storm ahead and changes thier direction. Some time later, the pilot determines that they are <span class="quantity">25 m</span> due north of where they previously checked thier position. The wind is still exerting a force on the helicopter of <span class="quantity">100 </span> in the due east direction. Find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during the second part of the flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h4>
<p>Find the helicopters's displacement from its original position after its two parts of its flight and use that to find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during the first two parts of flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h4>
<p>How does your answer to the previous part connect to the answers to the first two parts?</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(e)</span></h4>
<p>In order to get further away from the storm, the pilot turns and flies <span class="quantity">45 °</span> west of due north for <span class="quantity">50 km</span>. The storm the pilot was avoiding has caused the wind to change as well. For this portion of the flight, the wind is exerting a force on the helicopter of <span class="quantity">125 </span> in the south direction. Find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during this part of the flight.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h4 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(f)</span></h4>
<p>Explain why you cannot take the total displacement of the three parts of the helicopter flight and calculate the total work done by the wind on the helicopter.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral.html#PA_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
