<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"><p>Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles of width <span class="process-math">\(x=20\)</span> cm and height <span class="process-math">\(y=10\)</span> cm. However, the machine isn't perfect, and therefore the width could be off by <span class="process-math">\(dx = \Delta x = 0.2\)</span> cm and the height could be off by <span class="process-math">\(dy = \Delta y = 0.4\)</span> cm.</p>
<p>The area of the rectangle is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/E_10_4_differential.html">
\begin{equation*}
A(x,y) = xy,
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is <span class="process-math">\(A(20, 10) =
200\)</span> square centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would like to know how much the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_10_4_differential.html" title="Equation 10.4.2">(10.4.2)</a>, and find that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/E_10_4_differential.html">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta A \approx dA = A_x(20, 10)~dx + A_y(20,10)~dy.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(A_x = y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A_y = x\text{,}\)</span> we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta A \approx dA = 10~dx + 20~dy = 10\cdot0.2 + 20\cdot0.4 = 10.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by as much as 10 square centimeters.</p></article></body>
