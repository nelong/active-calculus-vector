<p>If a continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of a single variable has two critical numbers <span class="process-math">\(c_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> at which <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has relative maximum values, then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must have another critical number <span class="process-math">\(c_3\text{,}\)</span> because “it is impossible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. The other critical point can be a saddle point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley).” (From <em class="emphasis">Calculus in Vector Spaces</em> by Lawrence J. Corwin and Robert H. Szczarb.) Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = 4x^2e^y -2x^4 -e^{4y}\text{.}\)</span> (From Ira Rosenholz in the Problems Section of the <em class="emphasis">Mathematics Magazine</em>, Vol. 60 NO. 1, February 1987.) Show that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has exactly two critical points, and that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has relative maximum values at each of these critical points. Explain how this function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> illustrates that it really is possible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to see graphically how this happens.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S-10-7-Optimization.html#exercise-241" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
