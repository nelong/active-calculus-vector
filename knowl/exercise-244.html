<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">A rectangular box with length <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> width <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and height <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is being built. The box is positioned so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the box lies in the first octant where <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> are all positive. There is an added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit underneath the plane with equation <span class="process-math">\(x + 2y + 3z = 6\text{.}\)</span> In fact, we will assume that the corner of the box “opposite” the origin must actually lie on this plane. The basic problem is to find the maximum volume of the box.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Sketch the plane <span class="process-math">\(x + 2y + 3z = 6\text{,}\)</span> as well as a picture of a potential box.  Label everything appropriately.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Explain how you can use the fact that one corner of the box lies on the plane to write the volume of the box as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> only.  Do so, and clearly show the formula you find for <span class="process-math">\(V(x,y)\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Find all critical points of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span>  (Note that when finding the critical points, it is essential that you factor first to make the algebra easier.)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Without considering the current applied nature of the function <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> classify each critical point you found above as a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Determine the maximum volume of the box, justifying your answer completely with an appropriate discussion of the critical points of the function.</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now suppose that we instead stipulated that, while the vertex of the box opposite the origin still had to lie on the plane, we were only going to permit the sides of the box, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> to have values in a specified range (given below).  That is, we now want to find the maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> on the closed, bounded region</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{2} \le x \le 1, \ \ 1 \le y \le 2.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Find the maximum volume of the box under this condition, justifying your answer fully.</div>
