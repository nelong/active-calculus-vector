<p>In each of the following problems, your task is to</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">(i).</span></span><p>sketch, by hand, the region over which you integrate</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">(ii).</span></span><p>set up iterated integral expressions which, when evaluated, will determine the value sought</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">(iii).</span></span><p>use appropriate technology to evaluate each iterated integral expression you develop</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note well: in some problems you may be able to use a double rather than a triple integral, and polar coordinates may be helpful in some cases.</p>

<li><p>Consider the solid created by the region enclosed by the circular paraboloid <span class="process-math">\(z = 4 - x^2 - y^2\)</span> over the region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane enclosed by <span class="process-math">\(y = -x\)</span> and the circle <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 4\)</span> in the first, second, and fourth quadrants.

<p>In a certain room in a house, the walls can be thought of as being formed by the lines <span class="process-math">\(y = 0\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y = 12 + x/4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = 12\text{,}\)</span> where length is measured in feet.  In addition, the ceiling of the room is vaulted and is determined by the plane <span class="process-math">\(z = 16 - x/6 - y/3\text{.}\)</span>  A heater is stationed in the corner of the room at <span class="process-math">\((0,0,0)\)</span> and causes the temperature in the room at a particular time to be given by</p>
