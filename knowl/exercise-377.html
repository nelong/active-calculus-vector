<p>In each of the following questions, set up an iterated integral expression whose value determines the desired result. Then, evaluate the integral first by hand, and then using appropriate technology.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the volume of the “cap” cut from the solid sphere <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4\)</span> by the plane <span class="process-math">\(z=1\text{,}\)</span> as well as the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinate of its centroid.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the center of mass of the portion of the unit sphere that lies in the first octant (i.e., where <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> are all nonnegative).  Assume that the density of the solid given by <span class="process-math">\(\delta(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{1+x^2+y^2+z^2}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Find the volume of the solid bounded below by the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane, on the sides by the sphere <span class="process-math">\(\rho=2\text{,}\)</span> and above by the cone <span class="process-math">\(\phi = \pi/3\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Find the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> coordinate of the center of mass of the region that is bounded above by the surface <span class="process-math">\(z = \sqrt{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\text{,}\)</span> on the sides by the cylinder <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 = 4\text{,}\)</span> and below by the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane.   Assume that the density of the solid is uniform and constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the volume of the solid that lies outside the sphere <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\)</span> and inside the sphere <span class="process-math">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2z\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
