<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Stokes.html" title="Theorem 12.11.5: Stokes’ Theorem">Stokes’ Theorem</a> is generally used to turn a line integral into a flux integral. Sometimes it is possible to be given a flux integral and recognize that the given vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\curl(\vG)\)</span> for some vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vG\text{,}\)</span> however. When this is the case, we call <span class="process-math">\(\vG\)</span> a <dfn class="terminology">vector potential</dfn> for the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\text{,}\)</span> much like a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\vF =

<div class="para">When finding an anti-derivative of a function of a single variable, you know that there is an infinite family of anti-derivatives, but that any two anti-derivatives differ by a constant. This is why we write expressions such as <span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle\int\cos(x)\, dx = \sin(x) + C\text{.}\)</span> A similar phenomenon occurs with (scalar) potential functions for gradient vector fields. Find a <em class="emphasis">second</em> vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vG\)</span> with the same curl as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task_Vector_StokesThm_potential_find.html" title="part 12.11.5.4.a">part a</a>, and do so in a way that <span class="process-math">\(\vF-\vG\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a constant vector.
