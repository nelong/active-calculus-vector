<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> we say that <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">open</dfn>  provided that for every point in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> there is a disc (in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span>) or ball (in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span>) centered at that point such that every point of the disc/ball is contained in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> For example, the set of points <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2 \lt 1\)</span> is open, since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc contained in the set (as illustrated by point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> in <a href="S_Vector_FTCLI.html#open_closed" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/open_closed.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 13.4.5">Figure 13.4.5</a>). However, if we change the inequality to <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2\leq 1\text{,}\)</span> then the set is not open, as any point on the circle <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2=1\)</span> cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside the set, that is with <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2&gt;1\)</span> (as illustrated by the point <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> in <a href="S_Vector_FTCLI.html#open_closed" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/open_closed.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 13.4.5">Figure 13.4.5</a>). We will also say that a region <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">path-connected</dfn> provided that for every pair of points in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> there is a path from one to the other contained in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span>
