<div class="para">If an oriented curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> ends at the same point where it started, we say that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn>. The line integral of a vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> along a closed curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">circulation</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> around <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> To emphasize the fact that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed, we sometimes write <span class="process-math">\(\oint_C \vF\cdot d\vr\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\int_C \vF\cdot d\vr\text{.}\)</span>  Circulation serves as a measure of a vector field’s tendency to rotate in a manner consistent with the orientation of the (closed) curve and is measured by looking at whether the vector field is working with or against the motion along the path.</div>
