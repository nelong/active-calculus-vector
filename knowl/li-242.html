<p>Up to this point, the products you have seen, such as the product of real numbers and the dot product of vectors, have been commutative, meaning that the product does not depend on the order of the terms.  For instance, <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot5 = 5\cdot 2\text{.}\)</span>  The table above suggests, however, that the cross product is <em class="emphasis">anti-commutative</em>: for any vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span>  <span class="process-math">\(\vu\times\vv =
-\vv\times\vu\text{.}\)</span> If we consider the case when <span class="process-math">\(\vu=\vv\text{,}\)</span> this shows that <span class="process-math">\(\vv\times\vv = -(\vv\times\vv)\text{.}\)</span>  What does this tell us about <span class="process-math">\(\vv\times\vv\text{;}\)</span>  in particular, what vector is unchanged by scalar multiplication by <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{?}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S-9-4-Cross-Product.html#li-242" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
