<p>Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-5.html#li-25" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
