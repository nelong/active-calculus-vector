<p>Recall that if a function <span class="process-math">\(f = f(x)\)</span> of a single variable is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x=x_0\text{,}\)</span> then</p>

We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x_0)\)</span> means that the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is locally linear at <span class="process-math">\(x=x_0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> looks like its linearization <span class="process-math">\(L(x) = f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{.}\)</span> That is, the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> can be closely approximated by <span class="process-math">\(L(x)\)</span> as long as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is close to <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{.}\)</span> We can measure how good the approximation of <span class="process-math">\(L(x)\)</span> is to <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> with the error function</p>
