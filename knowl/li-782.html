<p>Suppose that the temperature on a metal plate is given by the function <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> with</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T(x,y) = 100-(x^2 + 4y^2),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are each measured in feet.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Find <span class="process-math">\(T_x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T_y\text{.}\)</span>  What are the units on these partial derivatives?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose an ant is walking along the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis at the rate of 2 feet per minute toward the origin.  When the ant is at the point <span class="process-math">\((2,0)\text{,}\)</span> what is the instantaneous rate of change in the temperature <span class="process-math">\(dT/dt\)</span> that the ant experiences.
