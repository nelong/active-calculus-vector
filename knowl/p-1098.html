<div class="para">Any time that an object is launched into the air with a given velocity and launch angle, the path the object travels is determined almost exclusively by the force of gravity. Whether in sports such as archery or shotput, in military applications with artillery, or in important fields like firefighting, it is important to be able to know when and where a launched projectile will land. We can use our knowledge of vector-valued functions in order to completely determine the path traveled by an object that is launched from a given position at a given angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity.</div>
