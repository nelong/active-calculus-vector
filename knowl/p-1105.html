<p>In light of being able to integrate and differentiate componentwise with vector-valued functions, we can solve many problems that are analogous to those we encountered in single-variable calculus. For instance, recall problems where we were given an object moving along an axis with velocity function <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and an initial position <span class="process-math">\(s(0)\text{.}\)</span> In that context, we were able to differentiate <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> in order to find acceleration, and integrate <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> and use the initial condition in order to find the position function <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> In the following activity, we explore similar ideas with vector-valued functions.</p>
