<div class="para">Assume we fire a projectile from a launcher and the only force acting on the fired object is the force of gravity pulling down on the object. That is, we assume no effect due to spin, wind, or air resistance. With these assumptions, the motion of the object will be planar, so we can also assume that the motion occurs in two-dimensional space. Suppose we launch the object from an initial position <span class="process-math">\((x_0, y_0)\)</span> at an angle <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> with the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_9_7_Motion.html" title="Figure 9.7.7">Figure 9.7.7</a>, and that we fire the object with an initial speed of <span class="process-math">\(v_0 = |\vv(0)|\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\vv(t)\)</span> is the velocity vector of the object at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Assume <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the positive constant acceleration force due to gravity, which acts to pull the fired object toward the ground (in the negative <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> direction). Note particularly that there is no external force acting on the object to move it in the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> direction.</div>
