<div class="para">To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an interstate highway cutting across a state. One way to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a function <span class="process-math">\(\vr\text{.}\)</span> If we encounter an accident or road construction, however, this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our position on the highway. If we know how far we've traveled along the highway, we know exactly where we are.</div>
