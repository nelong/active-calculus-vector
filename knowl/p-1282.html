<div class="para">Informally speaking, the curvature will be the rate at which the angle <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> is changing as we move along the curve. Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move along the curve; if we move with a greater speed along the curve, then <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> will change more rapidly. This is why the speed limit is sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words, the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(\phi\)</span> will depend on the parametrization we use to describe the space curve. To eliminate this dependence on the parametrization, we choose to work with an arc length parametrization <span class="process-math">\(\vr(s)\text{,}\)</span> which means we move along the curve with unit speed.</div>
