<div class="para">The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the curve at that point. The curvature at a point on a curve describes the <em class="emphasis">circle</em> that best approximates the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> has curvature <span class="process-math">\(1/a\text{,}\)</span> then the circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose curvature is <span class="process-math">\(\kappa\)</span> has radius <span class="process-math">\(1/\kappa\)</span> and will be tangent to the tangent line at that point and has its center on the concave side of the curve. This circle, called the <em class="emphasis">osculating circle</em> of the curve at the point, is shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_9_8_osculating.html" title="Figure 9.8.7">Figure 9.8.7</a> for a portion of a parabola.</div>
