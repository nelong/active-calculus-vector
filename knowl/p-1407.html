<div class="para">In this section, we will study limits of functions of several variables, with a focus on limits of functions of two variables. In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite integral. In this section we will begin to understand how the concept of limit for functions of two variables is similar to what we encountered for functions of a single variable. The limit will again be the fundamental idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit of a function of several variables to define the important concept of differentiability later in this chapter. We have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in <a href="S-9-7-Vector-Valued-Functions-Derivatives.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.7: Derivatives and Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions">Section 9.7</a>.</div>
