<div class="para">To investigate the limit of a single variable function, <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x\to
a}f(x)\text{,}\)</span> we often consider the behavior of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the right and from the left. Similarly, we may investigate limits of two-variable functions, <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{(x,y)\to(a,b)} f(x,y)\)</span> by considering the behavior of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> from various directions. This situation is more complicated because there are infinitely many ways in which <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> may approach <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{.}\)</span> In the next activity, we see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.</div>
