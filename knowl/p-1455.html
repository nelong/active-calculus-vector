<p>This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If we find two different paths that result in two different limits, then we may conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different paths.</p>
