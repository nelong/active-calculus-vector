<p>Notice that <a href="C_Vector.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 12: Vector Calculus">Chapter 12</a> is a work in progress in a few ways:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Answers and solutions to many activities are not yet written.</p></li>
<li><p>WeBWorK exercises have not yet been added.</p></li>
<li><p>Some sections lack exercises altogether.</p></li>
<li><p>Sections on line integrals and surface integrals of <em class="emphasis">scalar</em> functions are yet to be added.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">We welcome suggestions of WeBWorK exercises that faculty think would be good inclusions as well as suggestions for exercise topics. We also welcome feedback on any aspect of this chapter. We have set up a <a class="external" href="https://forms.gle/R1YNrPMC6q9Z2H3n8" target="_blank">Google Form</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-9-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> to collect feedback. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has delayed a final release of these materials. Perhaps by August 2022, they will be ready in a complete, public form, but we hope you continue to find them useful until then.</p>
