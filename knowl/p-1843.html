<div class="para">As we have found in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/A_10_3_2a.html" title="Activity 10.3.3">Activities 10.3.3</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/A_10_3_6.html" title="Activity 10.3.4">Activity 10.3.4</a>, we may think of <span class="process-math">\(f_{xy}\)</span> as measuring the “twist” of the graph as we increase <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> along a particular trace where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is held constant. In the same way, <span class="process-math">\(f_{yx}\)</span> measures how the graph twists as we increase <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> If we remember that Clairaut's theorem tells us that <span class="process-math">\(f_{xy} = f_{yx}\text{,}\)</span> we see that the amount of twisting is the same in both directions. This twisting is perhaps more easily seen in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_10_3_ruled.html" title="Figure 10.3.8">Figure 10.3.8</a>, which shows the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = -xy\text{,}\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(f_{xy} = -1\text{.}\)</span>
