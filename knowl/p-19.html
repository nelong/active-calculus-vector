<div class="para">This text is an extension of the single variable <em class="emphasis">Active Calculus</em> by Matt Boelkins. The initial drafts of this multivariable edition were written by Steve Schlicker; editing and revisions were made by David Austin and Matt Boelkins. David Austin is responsible for the beautiful full-color graphics in Chapters 9 through 11. Many people at GVSU have shared their ideas and resources, which undoubtedly had a significant influence on the product. We thank them for all of their support. Most importantly, we would like to thank the students who have used this text and offered helpful advice and suggestions.</div>
