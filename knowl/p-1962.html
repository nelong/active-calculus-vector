<div class="para">As a consequence, whenever a function <span class="process-math">\(z = f(x,y)\)</span> is continuously differentiable at a point <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\text{,}\)</span> it follows that the function has a tangent plane at <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\text{.}\)</span> Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually indistinguishable. (We won’t formally define differentiability of multivariable functions here, and for our purposes continuous differentiability is the only condition we will ever need to use. It is important to note that continuous differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to continuously differentiable functions.)  In addition, as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_10_4.html" title="Preview Activity 10.4.1">Preview Activity 10.4.1</a>, we find the following general formula for the tangent plane.</div>
