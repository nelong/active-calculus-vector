<div class="para">Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for a general function <span class="process-math">\(f=f(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> we need to discuss a technical condition. As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable function on a small scale near a point <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> we expect to see a line; in this case, we say that <em class="emphasis"><span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is locally linear near <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span></em> since the graph looks like a linear function locally around <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{.}\)</span> Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=|x|\text{,}\)</span> that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.</div>
