<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider <span class="process-math">\(f = f(x)\)</span> as a function of one variable. If we let <span class="process-math">\(x = x_0+h\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(|h|\)</span> is the distance from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> then the relative error in approximating <span class="process-math">\(f(x_0+h)\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(L(x_0+h)\)</span> is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{E(x_0+h)}{h}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Show that, for a function <span class="process-math">\(f = f(x)\)</span> of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span>

</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function <span class="process-math">\(f = f(x,y)\)</span> at a point <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\text{,}\)</span> then if <span class="process-math">\(x = x_0+h\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = y_0+k\text{,}\)</span> the distance from <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{h^2+k^2}\text{.}\)</span>
