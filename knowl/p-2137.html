<div class="para">It is important to note the differences among the derivatives in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_10_5_chain_rule.html" title="Equation 10.5.3">(10.5.3)</a>. Since <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is a function of the two variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> the derivatives in the Chain Rule for <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are partial derivatives. However, since <span class="process-math">\(x = x(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = y(t)\)</span> are functions of the single variable <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> their derivatives are the standard derivatives of functions of one variable. When we compose <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t)\text{,}\)</span> we then have <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> as a function of the single variable <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> making the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> a standard derivative from single variable calculus as well.</div>
