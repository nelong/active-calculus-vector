<div class="para">Up to this point, we have applied the Chain Rule to situations where we have a function <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> of variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> with both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> depending on another single quantity <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> We may apply the Chain Rule, however, when <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> each depend on more than one quantity, or when <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> is a function of more than two variables. It can be challenging to keep track of all the dependencies among the variables, and thus a tree diagram can be a useful tool to organize our work. For example, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> depends on <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> both depend on <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> We may represent these relationships using the tree diagram shown at left <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_10_5_tree_1.html" title="Figure 10.5.3">Figure 10.5.3</a>. We place the dependent variable at the top of the tree and connect it to the variables on which it depends one level below. We then connect each of those variables to the variable on which each depends.</div>
