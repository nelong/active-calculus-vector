<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_10_6.html" title="Preview Activity 10.6.1">Preview Activity 10.6.1</a>, we saw how we could measure the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> in a situation where both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> were changing; in that activity, however, we found that this rate of change was measured in “units of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> per unit of <em class="emphasis">time</em>.” In a given unit of time, we may move more than one unit of distance. In fact, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_10_6.html" title="Preview Activity 10.6.1">Preview Activity 10.6.1</a>, in each unit increase in time we move a distance of <span class="process-math">\(| \vv | = 5\)</span> feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of our choice, we instead want to have a rate of change whose units are “units of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> per unit of distance in the given direction.”</div>
