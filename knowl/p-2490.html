<div class="para">For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the role that closed intervals did for functions of a single variable. A closed region is a region that contains its boundary (the unit disk <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2 \leq 1\)</span> is closed, while its interior <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2 \lt  1\)</span> is not, for example), while a bounded region is one that does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for functions of a single variable, continuous functions of several variables that are defined on closed, bounded regions must have absolute maxima and minima in those regions.</div>
