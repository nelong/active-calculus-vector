<p>This approach is consistent with the following goals:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.</p></li>
<li><p>To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable calculus are natural and true.  We strive to accomplish this by using specific cases to highlight the ideas for the general situation using contexts that are common and familiar.</p></li>
<li><p>To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multivariable calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, through working on activities in small groups in class, and through doing substantial exercises outside of class time.</p></li>
<li><p>To strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable calculus.</p></li>
</ul>
