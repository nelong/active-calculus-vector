<div class="para">If we are at a point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain of a function of one variable, there are only two directions in which we can move: in the positive or negative <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-direction. If, however, we are at a point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> in the domain of a function of two variables, there are many directions in which we can move. Thus, it is important for us to have a means to indicate direction, and we will do so using vectors. This notion of direction in space will be critical for us to find direction vectors for lines, tangent lines to curves, normal vectors to planes, and to determine direction of motion.</div>
