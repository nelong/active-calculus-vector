<div class="para">Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to describe the appearance of text or graphics. A simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,-1)\)</span> is the following:</div>
<pre class="code-display tex2jax_ignore"> 
          (0,0) moveto 
          (1,1) lineto stroke
          (1,-1) lineto stroke
          (0,0) lineto stroke
          </pre>
<div class="para">The key idea in these commands is that we start at the origin, then tell Postscript that we want to start at the point <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> draw a line from the point <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> (this is what the lineto and stroke commands do), then draw lines from <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((1,-1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,-1)\)</span> back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair <span class="process-math">\(\langle x, y \rangle\)</span> (this pair <span class="process-math">\(\langle x, y \rangle\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">vector</dfn>), where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the horizontal displacement and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> is represented by the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle 1,1 \rangle\text{.}\)</span>
