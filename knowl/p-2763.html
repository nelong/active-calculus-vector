<div class="para">A scatterplot of the data would show that, while the relationship between <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is not exactly linear, it looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear, but only approximately linear.</div>
