<div class="para">This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many different ways. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle 3, 4\rangle\text{,}\)</span> which represents a horizontal change of three units and a vertical change of four units. We may place the <em class="emphasis">tail</em> of the vector (the point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the <em class="emphasis">tip</em> (the terminal point of the vector) at <span class="process-math">\((3,4)\text{,}\)</span> as illustrated at left in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-9-2-vectors-standard.html" title="Figure 9.2.3">FigureÂ 9.2.3</a>. A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in <em class="emphasis">standard position</em>.</div>
