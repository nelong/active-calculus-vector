<p>An article by C.Kenneth Tanner of the University of Georgia argues that, due to the concept of social distance, a secondary school classroom for 20 students should have 1344 square feet of floor space. Suppose a classroom is 32 feet by 42 feet by 8 feet. Set the origin <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> of the classroom to be its center. In this classroom, a student is sitting on a chair whose seat is at location <span class="process-math">\(A = (9, -6, -1.5)\text{,}\)</span> an overhead projector is located at position <span class="process-math">\(B = (0,1,3)\text{,}\)</span> and the teacher is standing at point <span class="process-math">\(C = (-2, 20, -4)\text{,}\)</span> all distances measured in feet. Determine the components of the indicated vectors and explain in context what each represents.</p>
