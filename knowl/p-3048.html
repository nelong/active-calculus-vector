<div class="para">The viewpoint of an iterated integral is closely connected to an important idea from single-variable calculus. When we studied solids of revolution, such as the one shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_6_2_Ex1.html" title="Figure 11.2.1">FigureÂ 11.2.1</a>, we saw that in some circumstances we could slice the solid perpendicular to an axis and have each slice be approximately a circular disk. From there, we were able to find the volume of each disk, and then use an integral to add the volumes of the slices. In what follows, we are able to use single integrals to generalize this approach to handle even more general geometric shapes.</div>
