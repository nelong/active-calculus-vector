<dt>Electronic Edition</dt>
<dd>
<p>Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them. Also, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to on-line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer. The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone.</p>
<p><em class="emphasis">Note.</em> In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links, so some availalable information is suppressed. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Activities Workbook</dt>
<dd><p>Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development.</p></dd>
<dt>Community of Users</dt>
<dd><p>Because this text is free and open-source, we hope that as people use the text, they will contribute corrections, suggestions, and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate such feedback is by email to Steve Schlicker at <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">schlicks@gvsu.edu</code>.</p></dd>
