<p>Taking into account your responses in (a), (b), and (c), describe the graph that results from the set of parametric equations</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
x(s,t) = \cos(t), \ \ \ \ y(s,t) = \sin(t), \ \ \ \ \text{ and }  \ \ \ \ z(s,t) = s,

<li><p>Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a “stack” of circles of constant radius, a cone can be viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius.  Modify the parametrizations of the circles above in order to construct the parameterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin, whose base radius is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane <span class="process-math">\(z = 3\text{.}\)</span> Use appropriate technology to plot the parametric equations you develop. (Hint: The cross sections parallel to the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane are circles, with the radii varying linearly as <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> increases.)</p></li>
