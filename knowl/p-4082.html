<div class="para">When it comes to thinking about particular surfaces in spherical coordinates, similar to our work with cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, we usually write <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{;}\)</span> this is a natural analog to polar coordinates, where we often think of our distance from the origin in the plane as being a function of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{.}\)</span> In spherical coordinates, we likewise often view <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\phi\text{,}\)</span> thus viewing distance from the origin as a function of two key angles.</div>
