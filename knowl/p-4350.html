<div class="para">The left plot shows some of the vectors and accurately depicts all of their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand, especially along the lines <span class="process-math">\(y=x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=-x\text{.}\)</span> The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform rescaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vectorâ€™s direction is completely accurate, but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the <em class="emphasis">relative</em> magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.</div>
