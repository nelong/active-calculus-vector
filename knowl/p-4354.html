<div class="para">Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects which is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth. The magnitude of the force vector is determined by the distance between the object and the earth (by an reciprocal squared relationship.) An illustration of this vector field can be seen in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_VectorFields_gravity.html" title="Figure 12.1.3">FigureÂ 12.1.3</a>, where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at larger distances from the origin (Earth).</div>
