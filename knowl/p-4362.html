<div class="para">Vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/vvf1_def.html" title="Definition 9.6.2">DefinitionÂ 9.6.2</a> a curve is traced by the terminal point of <span class="process-math">\(\vr(t)\text{,}\)</span> a function that has a real number as an input and produces a vector in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take a point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> (or a point <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span>) as an input and produce a vector (typically in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> respectively) as output.</div>
