<div class="para">As <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_VectorFields.html" title="Preview Activity 12.1.1">Preview Activity 12.1.1</a> showed, a <dfn class="terminology">velocity vector field</dfn> is an example of a scenario where associating a vector to each point in a region is useful. We denote such a vector field by <span class="process-math">\(\vF(x,y)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\vF(x,y,z)\text{,}\)</span> where the vector associated to the point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_VectorFields_FluidVelocity.html" title="Figure 12.1.2">Figure 12.1.2</a> shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.</div>
