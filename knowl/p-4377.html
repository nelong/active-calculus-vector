<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_VectorFields.html" title="Preview Activity 12.1.1">Preview Activity 12.1.1</a> gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields <span class="process-math">\(\vF(x,y) = \langle y,x\rangle\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vG(x,y) = \langle 0,-x\rangle\text{.}\)</span> It would be impossible to sketch <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computers can do a great job of making such sketches.  One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors in computer plots are typically scaled, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in this text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF(x,y) = y\vi + x\vj\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_VectorFields_scalefield.html" title="Figure 12.1.5">Figure 12.1.5</a>.</div>
