<div class="para">In the previous activity, we looked a special type of curve in a vector field, namely the curve that flows with the output of the vector field. Geometrically, the output vectors of the vector field will be tangent to the flow curves. These flow curves come up in several physical situations, including as solution curves to a system of differential equations. We will not discuss these applications here but you should should look out for uses of vector fields in the next few math courses.</div>
