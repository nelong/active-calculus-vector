<div class="para">Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. Functions of several variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several variables.</div>
