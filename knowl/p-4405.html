<div class="para">As we discussed in <a href="S_Vector_VectorFields.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.1: Vector Fields">Section 12.1</a>, vector fields are often used to represent forces such as gravity or electromagnetism, as well as the velocity of movement for things like wind or flowing water. We learned in <a href="S-9-3-Dot-Product.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.3: The Dot Product">Section 9.3</a> that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the start of its displacement vector to the end. However, this calculation assumes that the force is constant in the region of movement and that the object moves in a straight line along the displacement vector. The situation is more complicated than a dot product calculation when an object’s movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.</div>
