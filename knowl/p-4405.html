<div class="para">As we discussed in <a href="S_Vector_VectorFields.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.1: Vector Fields">Section 12.1</a>, vector fields are often useful as representations of forces such as gravity or electromagnetism, as well as representing the velocity of movement for things like wind or flowing water. <aside class="aside aside-like"><h3 class="heading"><span class="title">Velocity versus Force.</span></h3>
<div class="para">Movement by things like air or water will exert a force on objects, so wind velocity vector fields are related to a force field but the relationship between a moving fluid and an object in the fuild can be complicated. Specifically, issues like drag/friction and cross sectional area are a critical part of this relationship and are not something that we will focus on in our discussion. In the exploration below, we will look at a simplified version of this situation.</div></aside> We learned in <a href="S-9-3-Dot-Product.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.3: The Dot Product">Section 9.3</a> that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the tail of its displacement vector to the tip. However, this calculation assumes that the force is constant in the region of movement and that the object moves in a straight line along the displacement vector. The situation is more complicated than a dot product calculation when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.</div>
