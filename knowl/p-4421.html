<p>Starting with one of the vectors near the point <span class="process-math">\((2,0)\text{,}\)</span> sketch a curve that follows the direction of the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\text{.}\)</span> To help visualize what you are doing, it may be useful to think of the vector field as the velocity vector field for some flowing water and that you are imagining tracing the path that a tiny particle inserted into the water would follow as the water moved it around.</p>
