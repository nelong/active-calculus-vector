<div class="para">Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern ourselves with <em class="emphasis">how</em> the object moves. In particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> to the point <span class="process-math">\((4,3)\)</span> by first going up the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis to <span class="process-math">\((0,3)\)</span> and then moving horizontally to <span class="process-math">\((4,3)\)</span> (illustrated by <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/oriented_curves.html" title="Figure 12.2.2">Figure 12.2.2</a>) than if the object moves along the line segment from <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> directly to <span class="process-math">\((4,3)\)</span>(illustrated by <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/oriented_curves.html" title="Figure 12.2.2">Figure 12.2.2</a>). Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the object moves from <span class="process-math">\((4,3)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> directly along a line segment (<span class="process-math">\(C_3\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/oriented_curves.html" title="Figure 12.2.2">Figure 12.2.2</a>). We say that a curve in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> is <dfn class="terminology">oriented</dfn> if we have specified the direction of travel along the curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.</div>
