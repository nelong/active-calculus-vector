<div class="para">As an example, suppose a painting weighing 50 pounds is to be hung from wires attached to the frame as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-9-1-forces.html" title="Figure 9.2.10">FigureÂ 9.2.10</a>. We need to know how much tension will be on the wires to know what kind of wire to use to hang the picture. Assume the wires are attached to the frame at point <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> be the vector emanating from point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> to the left and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> the vector emanating from point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> to the right. Assume <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> makes a <span class="process-math">\(60^{\circ}\)</span> angle with the horizontal at point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> makes a <span class="process-math">\(45^{\circ}\)</span> angle with the horizontal at point <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> Our goal is to determine the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> in order to calculate their magnitudes.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Treat point <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> as the origin. Use trigonometry to find the components <span class="process-math">\(u_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(u_2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\vu = u_1 \vi + u_2 \vj\text{.}\)</span> Since we don't know the magnitude of <span class="process-math">\(\vu\text{,}\)</span> your components will be in terms of <span class="process-math">\(|\vu|\)</span> and the cosine and sine of some angle. Then find the components <span class="process-math">\(v_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v_2\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\vv = v_1 \vi + v_2 \vj\text{.}\)</span> Again, your components will be in terms of <span class="process-math">\(|\vv|\)</span> and the cosine and sine of some angle.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The total force holding the picture up is given by <span class="process-math">\(\vu+\vv\text{.}\)</span> The force acting to pull the picture down is given by the weight of the picture. Find the force vector <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> acting to pull the picture down.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The picture will hang in equilibrium when the force acting to hold it up is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force acting to pull it down. Equate these forces to find the components of the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\text{.}\)</span>
