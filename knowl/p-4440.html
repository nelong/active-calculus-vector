<div class="para">Notice that there are, in general, many ways to parametrize an oriented curve. With line segments, it is common to have the parameter range from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> although there are sometimes good reasons to choose another method. For circles and ellipses, you may find it useful to interchange the placement of <span class="process-math">\(\cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin(t)\)</span> to change the orientation, but then careful attention will need to be paid to the start and end points. The interactive graphing applet below allows you to plot parametric curves. Click the “Animate” button to trace out the curve from your lower value of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> to your upper value of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> (Type enter/return on your keyboard to update the graph after editing a text box.) For curves in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{,}\)</span> check the “Restrict view to 2D” for ease of viewing.</div>
