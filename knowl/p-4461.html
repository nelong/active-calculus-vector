<div class="para">The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to calculate line integrals. As with the limits in the definition of every other type of integral we've studied so far, the limit in the definition of the line integral is is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in the case where the oriented curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is composed of horizontal and vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a single-variable integral, as the following example shows.</div>
