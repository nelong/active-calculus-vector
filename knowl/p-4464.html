<div class="para">We are able to say a bit here about conditions that guarantee the limit in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_LineIntegral.html" title="Definition 12.2.9">Definition 12.2.9</a> exists. First, we require that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a relatively “nice” curve. We say that a curve is <dfn class="terminology">smooth</dfn> provided that it can be parameterized with functions that are infinitely differentiable. We do not require that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be smooth, but only that it be <dfn class="terminology">piecewise smooth</dfn>, which means that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> can be separated into parts which are indnividuall smooth. The other requirement is that <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is a continuous vector field, by which we mean that each component function of <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is continuous as a function of <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> variables.</div>
