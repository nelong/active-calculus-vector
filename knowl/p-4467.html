<div class="para">If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product <span class="process-math">\(\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i\)</span> makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. Note here that our vector <span class="process-math">\(\Delta\vr_i\)</span> is the displacement from <span class="process-math">\(\vr_{i-1}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\vr_i\text{.}\)</span> If the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vr_i\)</span> and the force field vector <span class="process-math">\(\vF(\vr_i)\)</span> point in directions with an acute angle between them, the dot product will be positive. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-28-hidden.html" title="Footnote 12.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative. In this case, we also note that the force field is hindering the aircraft’s progress. This interpretation carries through with our limit argument above. Specifically, the line integral over a curve will be positive if more of the vector field is in the direction of travel than against the direction of travel. You will need to consider the value of the dot product and not just the sign when assessing whether a line integral will be positive/neagtive/zero.</div>
