<p>Just as when we differentiated a vector-valued function <span class="process-math">\(\vr(t)\)</span> to find a tangent vector, we begin by dividing a curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> oriented from a point <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to a point <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> into <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> small, straight pieces. Each of these pieces is in an area where the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is nearly constant, provided we use enough pieces. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_IdeaLineIntegral_CurveVectors.html" title="Figure 12.2.2">FigureÂ 12.2.2</a>, we show this situation. Each <span class="process-math">\(\vr_i\)</span> is the tip of a vector that traces out the curve, which makes the vectors <span class="process-math">\(\Delta\vr_i = \vr_{i+1}-\vr_i\)</span> (shown in blue) approximate the curve <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The green vectors are the vectors in the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> at each of the designated points along the curve.</p>
