<p>If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product <span class="process-math">\(\vF(\vr_i)\cdot \Delta\vr_i\)</span> makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. This is because if the vector <span class="process-math">\(\vr_i\)</span> along the curve and the force field vector <span class="process-math">\(\vF(\vr_i)\)</span> point in similar directions, the dot product will be positive. <a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-27-hidden.html" title="Footnote 12.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. Taking the sum over <span class="process-math">\(i=0,\dots,n-1\text{,}\)</span> we have a Riemann sum that approximates the work done by the vector field on the aircraft as it flies along <span class="process-math">\(C\text{:}\)</span></p>
