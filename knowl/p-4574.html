<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals.html" title="Preview Activity 12.3.1">Preview Activity 12.3.1</a> has shown us that it is possible to evaluate line integrals without needing to work with Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line segments. It was not critical that the paths in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals.html" title="Preview Activity 12.3.1">Preview Activity 12.3.1</a> were straight lines, but rather that the paths had a description where both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> could be expressed in terms of one variable. Fortunately, parametrizing the oriented curve along   which a line integral is calculated provides exactly the tool we are looking for. Namely a parameterization gives a way to express the <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> poinss of the oriented curve in terms of a single variable (the parameter). Note that given a parameterization, we can also translate the vector field component equations into functions of the parameter as well.</div>
