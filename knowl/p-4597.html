<p><a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals.html" title="Preview Activity 12.3.1">Preview Activity 12.3.1</a> has shown us that it is possible to evaluate line integrals without needing to resort to working with Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line segments. It was not critical that the paths in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_ParamLineIntegrals.html" title="Preview Activity 12.3.1">Preview Activity 12.3.1</a> were straight lines, but rather that the paths had a description where both <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> could be expressed in terms of one variable. Fortunately, parametrizing the oriented curve along which a line integral is calculated provides a powerful tool for evaluating line integrals.</p>
