<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ScalarLineIntegral_def.html" title="Definition 12.4.4: The Line Integral of a Scalar Function">DefinitionÂ 12.4.4</a> defined <span class="process-math">\(\int_C f \enspace ds\)</span> in terms of a limit of a Riemann sum which is usually very useful for understanding what is being measured and not very useful when it comes to efficiently calculating the value of a given integral. A scalar line integral is presented algebraically in terms of three variables because the curve is given in terms of points in three coordinates and the function to be integrated is dependent on those same coordinate values. Geometrically, the scalar line integral is a one dimensional problem because we only have one dimension to travel; namely we can travel along the curve (in steps of arc length). Remember that a parameterization of a curve in space is a description of how to travel through the <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> points of the curve in terms of a parameter (usually given as <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>) Parameterizations are very useful converting the three-variable algebra of a scalar line integral problem into a one dimensional integral.</div>
