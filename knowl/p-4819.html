<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\vF=\langle F_1,F_2\rangle\)</span> be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, path-connected region <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> We will assume that <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{.}\)</span> We want to define a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> by using the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign <span class="process-math">\(f(x_0,y_0)\)</span> an arbitrary value. (Setting <span class="process-math">\(f(x_0,y_0)=0\)</span> is probably convenient, but we wonâ€™t explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that <span class="process-math">\(f(x_0,y_0)\)</span> is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> define</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is any oriented path from <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is path-connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is path-independent, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is well-defined. If different paths from <span class="process-math">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> gave different values for the line integral, then we would not be sure what <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> really is.</div>
