<div class="para">In this section, we will go through the process for how to measure the density of the “creation” or “destruction” of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point. Next, using a limit, we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because our vector fields will change in a continuous fashion, we won't have the vector field actually change at a single point. Rather, we will really be measuring the density for the change in strength of the vector field.</div>
