<div class="para">In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called Copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amoung of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine. The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.</div>
