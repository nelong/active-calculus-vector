<div class="para">The notation for a scalar line integral (<span class="process-math">\(\int_C f \, ds \)</span>) may not immediately make sense. As with the other types of integration we have done (single variable integration, double integrals, line integrals of vector fields, etc.), the subscript of the integral symbol denotes the region of integration. In the case of a scalar line integral, the region of integration is a collection of points given by a curve in space. The function we are integrating is <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> a scalar-valued functiton of multiple variables. The differential <span class="process-math">\(ds\)</span> may seem unusual to you. If you remember from <a href="S-9-8-Arc-Length-Curvature.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.8: Arc Length and Curvature">SectionÂ 9.8</a>, <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is the arc length of a curve in space. So the differential <span class="process-math">\(ds\)</span> in the scalar line integral notation means that we are adding up the output of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> over steps in arc length. This should make sense in terms of how we set up our Riemann sums. We did not set up the pieces of our curve as steps in <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(z\text{,}\)</span> but rather as steps in arc length (estimated by <span class="process-math">\(|{\vr_{i+1}-\vr_{i}}|\)</span>). This may feel similar to situations such as double integrals, where we generically used <span class="process-math">\(dA\)</span> for the differential, but the different contexts called for different values of <span class="process-math">\(dA\text{.}\)</span> For instance, in polar coordinates, we use <span class="process-math">\(dA = r\, dr\, d\theta\)</span>
