<div class="para">We know from <a href="S_Vector_FTCLI.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.5: Path-Independent Vector Fields and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals">SectionÂ 12.5</a> that a vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> It is probably not surprising that, given the multitude of names we have for path-independent vector fields, they are important vector fields that arise frequently. However, not every vector field is path-independent, and many times we will want to calculate the circulation around a closed curve in a vector field that is not path-independent. This section explores a connection between line integrals and double integrals that you may find surprising.</div>
