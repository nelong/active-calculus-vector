<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_Vector_ScalarLineIntegral_caution.html" title="Activity 12.5.3">Activity 12.5.3</a>, it may have been tempting to note that output of the function being integrated is simply the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinate of the points on the curve to try to make an argument by symmetry. Since we are adding up the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values of the points on <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinates on <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> go from <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-coordinates on <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> go from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> you may have wanted to argue that the values of <span class="process-math">\(\int_{C_1} x \, ds \)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\int_{C_2} x \, ds \)</span> will cancel out to zero. However, as you found, this is not correct because the scalar line integrals are not just adding up the output of our scalar function. The Riemann sum used in the scalar line integral is adding up the product of the scalar function’s output with the displacement of the segment used. Because the displacement used in <span class="process-math">\(C_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C_2\)</span> will not be symmetric, we cannot make the geometric cancelation argument as in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/task1_sli_pm.html" title="Task 12.5.6.a">part 12.5.6.a</a>.</div>
