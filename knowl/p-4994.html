<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_GreensTheorem.html" title="Preview Activity 12.8.1">Preview Activity 12.8.1</a>, you integrated the circulation density of a smooth vector field over a disk and found the result was equal to the circulation of the vector field along the region's circular boundary. This relationship is the theme of this section. To see why this would make sense, consider the region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> bounded by the curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_circ_cartoon.html" title="Figure 12.8.1">Figure 12.8.1</a>. We have placed a square grid inside <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> to suggest the idea of breaking <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> up into many smaller regions, most of which are square. This idea should make you think of the methods we have already seen of breaking up a region into smaller and smaller regions for Riemann sums.</div>
