<div class="para">There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises.  Rather than repeat a large list of standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable calculus problems. In this text, each section begins with several anonymous WeBWorK exercises, and follows with several  challenging problems. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in <a class="external" href="https://activecalculus.org/multi/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">the .html version of the text</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>. Almost every non-WeBWorK problem has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.  For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available <a class="external" href="www.apexcalculus.com" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">APEX Calculus</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> text by Greg Hartmann et al.</div>
