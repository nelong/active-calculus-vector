<p>We first need to consider how we want to represent and measure rotation in three dimensions. When we developed the circulation density on the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane, we measured the rotational strength at a point <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> with an axis of rotation coming out of the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. This corresponds to the axis of rotation being given by the blue vector in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_Curl_RotIn3D.html" title="Figure 12.7.9">Figure 12.7.9</a>. Remember that “positive” rotation corresponds to counterclockwise rotation in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. We can generalize this idea to think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and</p></li>
<li><p>the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">By convention, we consider positive “rotation” to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the terminal point of the vector to its initial point.  In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_Curl_3DRotations.html" title="Figure 12.7.10">Figure 12.7.10</a>, you can see that each vector corresponds to the rotation displayed and is consistent with the conventions described above.</p>
