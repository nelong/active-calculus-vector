<div class="para">The divergence of a vector field is a scalar measurement at a point that measures how the strength of the vectof field is changing as we look small neighborhoods around our point. While <a href="S_Vector_Div.html#SS_Vector_Div_Development" class="internal" title="Subsection 12.6.2: Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field">Subsection 12.6.2</a> will show the details for how the divergence is defined, we can make the following qualitative argument: If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{,}\)</span> then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. We make this measurement of changing strength of the vector field by measureing how much of a vector field flows into versus out of a small neighborhood of our point (as was done in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_Div.html" title="Preview Activity 12.6.1">Preview Activity 12.6.1</a>). When looking at a small neighborhood of the point (as shown by the square in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_S_Vector_Div_box.html" title="Figure 12.6.15">Figure 12.6.15</a>), only the change of the horizontal component of the vector field contributes to flow in or out on the sides and only the change in the vertical component contributes to flow in or our on the top and bottom.</div>
