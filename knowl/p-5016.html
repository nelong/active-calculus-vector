<div class="para">So far in this section, we have restricted ourselves to relatively nice closed curves when thinking about circulation. While the main theorem of this section will not allow us to consider arbitrary closed curves, it does cover more varied curves than we have discussed so far. A <dfn class="terminology">simple closed curve</dfn> is a closed curve that does not cross itself, and these are the curves to which our next theorem applies.</div>
