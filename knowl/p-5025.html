<div class="para">The amount of the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> that is created inside the square around the point <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> can be measured by the net amount of the vector field coming in or going out of the square. The amount of vector flow that goes through each of the boundary segments can be measured by looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field on each particular segment. For instance, on the top segment (in blue), the vertical component <span class="process-math">\(F_2\)</span> determines how much of the vector field goes in or out of the square. Integrating just the vertical component <span class="process-math">\(F_2\)</span> of the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> over the points on the top segment of our square will therefore measure how much of the vector field goes through the top of the square.</div>
