<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\vF=\langle x, y \rangle\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(\divg(\vF)= \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} (x)+ \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} (y) = 1+1=2\text{.}\)</span> From our conceptual description above, <span class="process-math">\(\divg(\vF)\)</span> being positive means that our vector field is increasing in strength. Since the divergence of <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> does not have a dependence on the input point, that means the vector field is increasing in strength, regardless of which point we consider. In the interactive element below, you can change the point you would like plotted and the size of the region around the point. You should see that regardless of what point you select or how small you make the region around the point, there will be more of the vector field flowing out of the region than in.</div>
