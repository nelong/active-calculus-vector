<div class="para">Another way to “see” divergence on a vector field plot is to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector field, then the divergence is zero. Also, remember that the divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and will change depending on location. The next activity asks you to graphically examine the divergence of three vector fields.</div>
