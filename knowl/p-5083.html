<div class="para">You may have noticed that this argument had a similar flow to the development of divergence in <a href="S_Vector_Div.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.6: The Divergence of a Vector Field">SectionÂ 12.6</a>. However, the result here is different because the property of the vector field we were trying to measure was different. Because divergence was developed to measure the change in the <em class="emphasis">strength</em> of the vector field (without regard to the direction), divergence is computed using the partial derivatives of the horizontal component of the vector field with respect to the horizontal variable and the vertical component of the vector field with respect to the vertical variable. The circulation density we just developed measures how the <em class="emphasis">direction</em> of the vector field is changing, and thus uses partial derivatives of the components with respect to the transverse variable. In other words, the rotational aspects of the vector field depend on how the horizontal component of the vector field changes when we move vertically (and vice versa).</div>
