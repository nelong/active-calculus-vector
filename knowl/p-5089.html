<p>Notice that the assumptions in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green's Theorem">Green's Theorem</a> require that the region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> be bounded by a simple closed curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and that the vector field have continuous partial derivatives on <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_region_hole.html" title="Exercise 12.8.5.2">ExerciseÂ 2</a>, we will explore what happens when the region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> cannot be bounded by a simple closed curve, as sometimes multiple applications of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green's Theorem">Green's Theorem</a> can be used in those circumstances. Now, however, we will take a look at what happens in some cases where the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is not smooth.</p>
