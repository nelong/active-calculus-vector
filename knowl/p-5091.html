<div class="para">We will start by measuring the circulation of a vector field on a path around the point <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> and use this measurement to define circulation density. Specifically, we will measure the circulation of a vector field as we move around a square centered at <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{.}\)</span> Using this measurement, we will calculate the circulation density by dividing our measurement by the area enclosed. This will allow us to compare our measurement across regions of different sizes. By taking the limit of this circulation density as the square's side length goes to zero, we will have the circulation density at the point <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{.}\)</span> Just as in our discussion of <a href="S_Vector_Div.html#SS_Vector_Div_Development" class="internal" title="Subsection 12.6.2: Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field">SubsectionÂ 12.6.2</a>, we will look at a two dimensional setting first, then examine how our argument can be generalized to higher dimensions.</div>
