<div class="para">By using a vector to represent the rotation of some element, we have enabled all of the tools that vectors allow, especially the ideas of projection and linear combinations. Remember that the projection of a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> onto a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> will give the vector component of <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> that is parallel to <span class="process-math">\(\vu\text{.}\)</span> In other words, the projection of <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> onto <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> is how much of <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is parallel to <span class="process-math">\(\vu\text{.}\)</span> The projection formula will allow us to take a vector representation of rotation and determine how much rotation happens around a given axis of rotation.</div>
