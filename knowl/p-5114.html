<div class="para">We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of spinner we imagine is illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_Curl_Spinner.html" title="Figure 12.7.3">Figure 12.7.3</a>. It consists of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner’s paddle. In this activity, we will be trying to assess how the the spinner will rotate around the black axel (as an axis of rotation).</div>
