<div class="para">A larger square is likely to have a larger total circulation since there is more distance to accumulate how much the vector field is moving in the same direction as our path. This is why the side length <span class="process-math">\(2h\)</span> of the square appears as a factor in the formula for our total circulation. In order to compare our rotational or circulation ideas over different sizes of squares, we will now look at the <dfn class="terminology">circulation density</dfn> (strength of rotation per unit area), which can be computed directly from our total circulation measurement. We can take the limit of the circulation density as we shrink the square to the central point <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> and get a measurement rotational strength of our vector field at a point.</div>
