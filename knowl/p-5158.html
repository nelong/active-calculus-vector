<div class="para">The curl of a vector field is itself a vector field in that evaluating <span class="process-math">\(\curl(\vF)\)</span> at a point gives a vector. As we saw earlier in this section, the vector output of <span class="process-math">\(\curl(\vF)\)</span> represents the rotational strength of the vector field <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> as a linear combination of rotational strengths (or circulation densities) from two-dimensional planar descriptions. From our description of vectors as a representation of rotations, We can think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and</div></li>
<li><div class="para">the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">By convention, we consider positive “rotation” to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the end of the vector to the base.</div>
