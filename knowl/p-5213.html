<div class="para">When we looked <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green's Theorem">Green's Theorem</a>, it was generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the circumstances described in exercises <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_AreaViaLineInt.html" title="Exercise 12.8.5.6">12.8.5.6</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ez_Vector_GreensTheorem_centroid.html" title="Exercise 12.8.5.8">12.8.5.8</a>, we did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector field. The situation for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Stokes.html" title="Theorem 12.11.5: Stokes' Theorem">Stokes' Theorem</a> will be similar, with the exception of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ez_Vector_StokesThm_potential.html" title="Exercise 12.11.4.4">ExerciseÂ 4</a> in this section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional piece of freedom: selecting the surface <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> through which we calculate the flux of <span class="process-math">\(\curl(\vF)\)</span> from amongst possibly several reasonable surfaces with boundary <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The next two activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their boundary.</div>
