<div class="para">A surface in three dimensions is said to be <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> if it has no boundary. Recalling the surfaces we studied in <a href="S_Vector_StokesThm.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.11: Stokes' Theorem">Section 12.11</a> where we applied <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Stokes.html" title="Theorem 12.11.5: Stokes' Theorem">Stokes' Theorem</a>, <em class="emphasis">none</em> of those surfaces were closed because the boundary of the surface through which we calculated the flux was the curve along which we calculated the circulation. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_DivThm_NotClosedSurfaces.html" title="Figure 12.12.1">Figure 12.12.1</a>, we show two surfaces that are <em class="emphasis">not</em> closed, as demonstrated by the red curves marking the edge where the surface ends.</div>
