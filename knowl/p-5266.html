<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_StokesThm.html" title="Preview Activity 12.11.1">Preview ActivityÂ 12.11.1</a>, we saw that a simple closed curve in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> can bound many different surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\)</span> that has a well-defined normal vector <span class="process-math">\(\vn\)</span> at every point and a boundary curve <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> We will use the normal vector to define an orientation of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> so that if a person were to walk along <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in the direction of the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\vn\text{,}\)</span> their left arm would be over the surface <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> Notice that this is the same convention that we used with <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green's Theorem">Green's Theorem</a> if we assume that the normal vector being used is <span class="process-math">\(\vk\text{.}\)</span></p>
