<div class="para">At first glance, it may seem that <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green’s Theorem">Green’s Theorem</a> is of purely intellectual interest. However, we have already encountered situations where parametrization a curve can be complicated. This is particularly true when the curve has “corners” that require us to give separate parametrizations for several pieces of the curve, such as with the rectangular curve pictured in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_Rectangle.html" title="Figure 12.8.4">Figure 12.8.4</a>. However, as with this rectangle, is often the case that a curve that is difficult to parametrize bounds a region that is not too complex to describe using rectangular or polar coordinates. For instance, the rectangular region in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_GreensTheorem_Rectangle.html" title="Figure 12.8.4">Figure 12.8.4</a> can be described as <span class="process-math">\(1\leq x\leq 4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2\leq y\leq 4\text{,}\)</span> rather than parametrization each of the four sides of the rectangle separately. Additionally, the integrand of the double integral in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green’s Theorem">Green’s Theorem</a> involves partial derivatives that can sometimes result in an integrand that is very easy to work with. The purpose of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green’s Theorem">Green’s Theorem</a> is, at its core, to allow you to exchange one type of integration problem (a line integral) for another type of integration problem (a double integral). This will be a recurring theme as this chapter continues.</div>
