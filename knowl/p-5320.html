<p>The divergence of a vector field was developed as a measurement of the density with which the strength of vector field is changing. In three dimensions, the divergence measures the volume density in which the vector field is being created or destroyed. This means that if we integrate the divergence of a vector field over a volume of space, we will get the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed in that particular volume of space. Since the net amount of a vector field that is created or destroyed in a volume of space is the same as the net flux of the vector field through the boundary of that volume (which is a closed surface), we have a correspondence between a triple integral of the divergence of a vector field on the interior of a closed surface and the flux integral of the vector field over the closed surface.</p>
