<div class="para">The types of regions in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> to which <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green’s Theorem">Green’s Theorem</a> applies are formally called <dfn class="terminology">simply connected regions</dfn>. To be precise, a simply connected region <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> is a set so that there is a path between every pair of points in <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> that stays inside <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> and any simple closed curve in <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> can be shrunk to a point while remaining inside <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> We can think of a simply connected region as being a region that does not have any “holes”. There are many instances where we can find a way to apply <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green’s Theorem">Green’s Theorem</a> multiple times to work with regions that are not simply connected, however.</div>
