<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_FluxInt_ParaPic.html" title="Figure 12.9.1">FigureÂ 12.9.1</a>, we plot a surface using a parametrization <span class="process-math">\(\vr(s,t)=\langle{f(s,t),g(s,t),h(s,t)}\rangle\text{.}\)</span> The magenta curves represent curves where <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> varies and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is held constant, while the yellow curves represent curves where <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> varies and <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is held constant. The vector in magenta is <span class="process-math">\(\vr_s=\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial s}=\langle{f_s,g_s,h_s}\rangle\)</span> which measures the direction and magnitude of change in the coordinates of the surface when only <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is varied. Similarly, the vector in yellow is <span class="process-math">\(\vr_t=\frac{\partial \vr}{\partial t}=\langle{f_t,g_t,h_t}\rangle\)</span> which measures the direction and magnitude of change in the coordinates of the surface when only <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is varied. We also plot the parallelogram that is formed by <span class="process-math">\(\vr_s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vr_t\text{,}\)</span> which is tangent to the surface. The area of this parallelogram offers an approximation for the surface area of a patch of the surface.</div>
