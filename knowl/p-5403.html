<div class="para">The central question we would like to consider is “How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a curved surface?”, so we only need to consider the amount of the vector field that flows <em class="alert">through</em> the surface. Any portion of our vector field that flows along (or tangent) to the surface will not contribute to the amount that goes through the surface. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_FluxInt_FieldSurface3.html" title="Figure 12.9.4">Figure 12.9.4</a>, we have split the vector field for points on our surface into two components. One component, plotted in green, is orthogonal to the surface. The component that is tangent to the surface is plotted in purple.</div>
