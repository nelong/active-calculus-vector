<div class="para">In our case, there is more surface area of <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> inside the parabolic cylinder than outside. For <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> points that are far away from the yellow surface, the magnitude of the output of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> for that point will be large. For <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> points that are close to the yellow surface, thier <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinates will be close to <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> and thus the output of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will be close to zero. This means that in order to properly estimate the scalar surface integral, we will need to assess whether there is a greater weighted surface area inside the parabolic cylinder than outside, where the weight of each surface area piece is given by how far the piece is from the yellow surface (the parabolic cylinder surface). This is not an easy argument to make and is not easy to verify visually for this example. For some examples you may be able to make a nice geometric arguement about the size of scalar surface integrals, but the algebraic calculation given by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ScalarSurfaceIntDef.html" title="Theorem 12.10.4">TheoremÂ 12.10.4</a> gives an exact value.</div>
