<div class="para">This result is a bit more difficult to to make sense of as being negative. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Scalar_Surface_Int_Example2.html" title="Figure 12.10.8">FigureÂ 12.10.8</a>, we have a plot of the surface <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> in blue and the parabolic cylinder surface given by <span class="process-math">\(z-x^2=0\)</span> is plotted in yellow. The points on the yellow surface correspond to where our scalar function (<span class="process-math">\(g(x,y,z)= z-x^2\)</span>) gives an output of zero. The points inside the parabolic cylinder have a <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinate greater than <span class="process-math">\(x^2\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will have a positive output for these points. The points outside of the parabolic cylinder have a <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinate less than <span class="process-math">\(x^2\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will have a negative output for these points. In order to make an argument about whether <span class="process-math">\(\int_{S_1} z-x^2 \, dS\)</span> is positive, negative, or zero, we will need to assess whether there is more surface area where <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> takes on positive values, more with negative values, or an equal amount of positive-negative values. Actually, our problem is even harder than this! Beacuse the Riemann sum is the product of the output for each piece of our surface times the surface area estimate, we will need to think about which points/pieces have larger or smaller outputs for <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> This is <em class="emphasis">very</em> difficult in general, because we need a systematic way of estimating both the output of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and the surface area of different pieces of the surface.</div>
