<div class="para">Thinking back to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Green.html" title="Theorem 12.8.3: Green’s Theorem">Green’s Theorem</a>, our main idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple closed curve in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> by taking the double integral of the circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_StokesThm.html" title="Preview Activity 12.11.1">Preview Activity 12.11.1</a>, we can break up <span class="process-math">\(\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr\)</span> into line integrals around other simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green’s Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green’s Theorem, we require that a simple closed curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> in three dimensions bound a smooth surface <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> with a normal vector <span class="process-math">\(\vn\text{.}\)</span> In doing this, we can choose our “smaller” curves similar to the squares we used in Green’s Theorem to lie on the surface <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> This gives us almost all the ingredients used in Green’s Theorem, but we still need to find a suitable replacement for the circulation density.</div>
