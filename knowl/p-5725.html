<div class="para">Recalling the surfaces we studied in <a href="S_Vector_StokesThm.html" class="internal" title="Section 12.11: Stokes’ Theorem">Section 12.11</a>, where we applied <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Stokes.html" title="Theorem 12.11.5: Stokes’ Theorem">Stokes’ Theorem</a>, notice that all of these surfaces had the property that they had a <dfn class="terminology">boundary</dfn> along which we calculated circulation. It turns out that giving a precise definition for boundary is challenging. For our purposes, however, you might think of a boundary curve of a surface as being a curve along which you could walk with your arms stretched out on either side with one arm lying over the surface and the other arm not lying over the surface as you walk. In this section, we will study <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn> surfaces in three dimensions, which are those surfaces without boundary. In <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "S_Vector_Stokesthm" missing or not unique]</code>, <em class="emphasis">none</em> of the surfaces were closed, because each had a boundary curve. On the other hand, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Vector_DivThm_NotClosedSurfaces.html" title="Figure 12.12.1">Figure 12.12.1</a>, we show two more surfaces that are <em class="emphasis">not</em> closed, as demonstrated by the magenta curves marking the edge where the surface ends.</div>
