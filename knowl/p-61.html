<div class="para">One of the techniques we use to study functions of one variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a 2-dimensional table, where we list the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values down the first column and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values across the first row. As an example, suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity) the horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial velocity <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> the object is given, and the angle <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> at which it is launched. If we let <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> represent the horizontal distance the object travels, then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a function of the two variables <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> and we represent <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> in functional notation by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/T-9-1-range.html">
\begin{equation*}
f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2 y)}{g},
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is the acceleration due to gravity. (Note that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is constant, 32 feet per second squared. We will derive this equation in a later section.) To create a table of values for <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> we list the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values down the first column and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values across the first row. The value <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y)\)</span> is then displayed in the location where the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> row intersects the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> column, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T-9-1-range.html" title="Table 9.1.5: Values of f(x,y) = \frac{x^2 \sin(2y)}{g}">Table 9.1.5</a> (where we measure <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in feet per second and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in radians).</div>
