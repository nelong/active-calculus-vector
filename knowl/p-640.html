<div class="para">To summarize, we have <span class="process-math">\(\vu\cdot(\vu\times\vv) = 0\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> is orthogonal to <span class="process-math">\(\vu\times\vv\text{.}\)</span> In the same way, we can show that <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> is orthogonal to <span class="process-math">\(\vu\times\vv\text{.}\)</span> The net effect is that <span class="process-math">\(\vu\times\vv\)</span> is a vector that is perpendicular to both <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\text{,}\)</span> and hence <span class="process-math">\(\vu\times\vv\)</span> is perpendicular to the plane determined by <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\vu\times\vv\)</span> is determined by applying the right-hand rule to <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vv\text{,}\)</span> as we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_9_4.html" title="Preview Activity 9.4.1">Preview ActivityÂ 9.4.1</a>. In light of our earlier work that showed <span class="process-math">\(|\vu||\vv|\sin(\theta) = |\vu\times\vv|.\text{,}\)</span> we may now express <span class="process-math">\(\vu \times \vv\)</span> in the following different way.</div>
