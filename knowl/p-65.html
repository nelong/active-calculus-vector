<p>We also often refer to the graph of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> of two variables as the <em class="emphasis">surface</em> generated by <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> Points in the form <span class="process-math">\((x,y,f(x,y))\)</span> are in three dimensions, so plotting these points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes — the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, and the <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis (called the <em class="emphasis">coordinate axes</em>). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a 3D coordinate system, as shown in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-9-1-left-right-hand.html" title="Figure 9.1.7">Figure 9.1.7</a>; thus, before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.</p>
