<div class="para">In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is <em class="emphasis">locally linear</em>.  In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function at a point, the graph looks like the tangent line to the function at that point. Linear functions played important roles in single variable calculus, useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (see Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (see Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will soon study curves in space; differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear as well. In addition, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.</div>
