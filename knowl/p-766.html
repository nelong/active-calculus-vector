<div class="para">Of course, it is common to represent lines in the plane using the slope-intercept equation <span class="process-math">\(y=mx
+ b\text{.}\)</span> The vector form of the line, described above, is an alternative way to represent lines that has the following two advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines, whose slope <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is not defined, using a vertical direction vector, such as <span class="process-math">\(\vv=\langle 0, 1\rangle\text{.}\)</span> Second, this description of lines works in any dimension even though there is no concept of the slope of a line in more than two dimensions.</div>
