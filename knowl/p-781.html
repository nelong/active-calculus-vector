<div class="para">Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions. We studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them in <a href="S-9-1-Functions.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.1: Functions of Several Variables and Three Dimensional Space">SectionÂ 9.1</a>. Each of those planes had one of the variables <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> equal to a constant. We can note that any vector in a plane with <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> constant is orthogonal to the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle 1,0,0 \rangle\text{,}\)</span> any vector in a plane with <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> constant is orthogonal to the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle 0,1,0 \rangle\text{,}\)</span> and any vector in a plane with <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> constant is orthogonal to the vector <span class="process-math">\(\langle 0,0,1 \rangle\text{.}\)</span> This idea works in general to define a plane.</div>
