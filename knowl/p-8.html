<p>Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus are best understood dynamically, and we encourage readers to make frequent use of technology to analyze graphs and data. Since technology changes so often, we refrain from indicating specific programs to use in the text. However, aside from computer algebra systems like <em class="emphasis">Maple</em>, <em class="emphasis">Mathematics</em>, or <em class="emphasis">Sage</em>, there are many free graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces or curves. These programs can be used by instructors and students to assist in the investigations and demonstrations. The use of these freely available applets is in accord with our philosophy that no one should be required to purchase materials to learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise to be openly shared. Below is a list of a few of the technological tools that are available (links active at the writing of this edition). Of course, you can find your own by searching the web.</p>
