<div class="para">When we study functions of several variables we are often interested in how each individual variable affects the function in and of itself. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA-9-1.html" title="Preview Activity 9.1.1">Preview ActivityÂ 9.1.1</a>, we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the amount initially invested and the duration of the investment. However, if we fix the initial investment, the amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the initial investment. This idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of several variables.</div>
