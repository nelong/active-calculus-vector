<div class="para">Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects, and thus we aspire to similarly express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms of a single variable. Vectors are a perfect vehicle for doing so — we can use vectors based at the origin to identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us to draw an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to identify and describe curves in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>-space for any <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> It will also allow us to represent traces and cross sections of surfaces in space.</div>
