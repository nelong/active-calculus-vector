<div class="para">The examples in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/A_9_6_1.html" title="Activity 9.6.2">Activity 9.6.2</a> illustrate that a parameterization allows us to look not only at the graph, but at the direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> changes. In the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can start at different points and move around the circle in either direction. The calculus of vector-valued functions — which we will begin to investigate in <a href="S-9-7-Vector-Valued-Functions-Derivatives.html" class="internal" title="Section 9.7: Derivatives and Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions">Section 9.7</a> — will enable us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of a particle moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the curve itself, but also to describe how motion occurs along the curve.</div>
