<div class="para">Note that throughout this section, we have implicitly assumed that we can parametrize the surface <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> in such a way that <span class="process-math">\(\vr_s\times \vr_t\)</span> gives a well-defined normal vector. Technically, this means that the surface be <dfn class="terminology">orientable</dfn>. Most “reasonable” surfaces are orientable. However, there are surfaces that are not orientable. Perhaps the most famous is formed by taking a long, narrow piece of paper, giving one end a half twist, and then gluing the ends together. Try doing this yourself, but before you twist and glue (or tape), poke a tiny hole through the paper on the line halfway between the long edges of your strip of paper and circle your hole. After gluing, place a pencil with its eraser end on your dot and the tip pointing away. Think of this as a potential normal vector. Keep the eraser on the paper, and follow the middle of your surface around until the first time the eraser is again on the dot. Is your pencil still pointing the same direction relative to the surface that it was before?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Vector_FluxInt.html#remark-1" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
