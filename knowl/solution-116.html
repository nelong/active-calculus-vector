<div class="para">To calculate <span class="process-math">\(\int_C\vF\cdot d\vr\text{,}\)</span> we start by working with the horizontal line segment.  Along that part of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> notice that <span class="process-math">\(d\vr\approx \Delta\vr = \Delta
x\vi\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line integral along this portion of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> consists of terms of the form <span class="process-math">\(\langle 2,1\rangle\cdot (\Delta x \vi) = 2\Delta
x\text{.}\)</span>  Along this part of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ranges from <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> and thus we can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral <span class="process-math">\(\int_1^4 2\, dx = 6\text{.}\)</span> Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that agrees with the orientation of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> we are not surprised to have a positive value here.</div> <div class="para">Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>  Here <span class="process-math">\(d\vr \approx \Delta\vr = \Delta y\vj\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\(\vF\cdot d\vr\approx 1\Delta y\text{.}\)</span> Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite integral <span class="process-math">\(\int_1^{-2} 1\, dy = -3\text{.}\)</span>  Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match the orientation of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>  Also, the negative value should not be unexpected, since <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is oriented in a direction for which the vectors of <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> point in a direction that would hinder motion along <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>
