<span class="process-math">\(\partial P /\partial t\text{:}\)</span> The unit is dollars per month (dollars/month). This is the rate at which payments change as the number of months it takes to pay off the loan changes.  The sign is negative because payments decrease as the pay-off time increases.  Thus <span class="process-math">\(\partial P /\partial t = -25\)</span> dollars/month. <span class="process-math">\(\partial P /\partial r\text{:}\)</span> The unit is dollars per percentage point (dollars/percent).  This is the rate at which payments change as the interest rate changes.  The sign is positive because payments increase as the interest rate increases.  Thus <span class="process-math">\(\partial P /\partial r = 5\)</span> dollars/percent.</div></body>
