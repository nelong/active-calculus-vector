Since <span class="process-math">\(p(x,y)=0\)</span> outside the region <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> the volume under the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is the same as the volume under the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> over the region <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(4\text{,}\)</span> . Finally, for a constant function to be a joint density function on <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> given by <span class="process-math">\(2 \le x \le 3,
