<p>We would like to see if the equality of the line integral and double integral in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA_Vector_GreensTheorem.html" title="Preview Activity 12.8.1">Preview ActivityÂ 12.8.1</a> was a coincidence or holds for more general vector fields. (Soon we will expand our curves beyond rectangles, but for the moment, we focus on the curve <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and region <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span>) To do this, we have to find some way to take our answer to the previous part of this activity, which includes two single integrals and turn them into a double integral over the rectangle <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>We have assumed that <span class="process-math">\(\vF\)</span> is smooth on <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> so the partial derivatives <span class="process-math">\(\partial
F_2/\partial x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\partial F_1/\partial y\)</span> are continuous functions on <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R\text{.}\)</span> Rewrite the expression you have for <span class="process-math">\(\oint_C\vF\cdot d\vr\)</span> in the previous step as the sum of two <em class="emphasis">double</em> integrals.</p>
