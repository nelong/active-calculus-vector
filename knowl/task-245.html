<div class="para">We can reuse the parameterization and calculations above for <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> here and skip right to setting up the iterated integral. We will take a moment here to note that converting our scalar function <span class="process-math">\(g(x,y,z)= z-x^2\)</span> to a function of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> will give <span class="process-math">\(g(s,t)=s-s^2 \cos(t)^2\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, we get the following iterated integral</div>

In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Scalar_Surface_Int_Example2.html" title="Figure 12.10.7">Figure 12.10.7</a> we have a plot of the surface <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> in blue and the parabolic cylinder surface given by <span class="process-math">\(z-x^2=0\)</span> is plotted in yellow. The points on the yellow surface correspond to where our scalar function (<span class="process-math">\(g(x,y,z)= z-x^2\)</span>) gives an output of zero. The points inside the parabolic cylinder have a <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinate greater than <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> (which means that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will have a positive output for these points.) The points outside of the parabolic cylinder have a <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinate less than <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> (which means that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will have a negative output for these points.) In order to make an argument about whether <span class="process-math">\(\int_{S_1} z-x^2 \enspace dS\)</span> is positive/negative/zero, we will need to assess whether there is more surface area with a positive output of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> more with a negative output, or an equal amount of positive-negative outputs. Actually, our problem is even harder than this. Beacuse the Riemann sum is the product of the output for each piece of our surface times the surface area estimate, we will need to think about which points/pieces have larger or smaller outputs for <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> This is <em class="alert">VERY</em> difficult in general because you will need to a systematic way of estimating both the output of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and the surface area of different pieces of your surface.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><iframe id="interactive-32" width="600" height="672" src="interactive-32-if.html"></iframe><figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">12.10.7<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>The surface <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is plotted with the surface given by <span class="process-math">\(z-x^2=0\)</span></figcaption></figure> <div class="para">In our case, there is more surface area of <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> inside the parabolic cylinder than outside. For <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> points that are far away from the yellow surface, the magnitude of the output of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> for that point will be large. For <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z)\)</span> points that are close to the yellow surface, thier <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-coordinates will be close to <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> and thus the output of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> will be close to zero. This means that in order to properly estimate the scalar surface integral, we will need to assess whether there is a greater weighted surface area inside the parabolic cylinder than outside, where the weight of each surface area piece is given by how far the piece is from the yellow surface (the parabolic cylinder surface). This is not an easy argument to make and is not easy to verify visually for this example. For some examples you may be able to make a nice geometric arguement about the size of scalar surface integrals, but the algebraic calculation given by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ScalarSurfaceIntDef.html" title="Theorem 12.10.4">Theorem 12.10.4</a> gives an exact value.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_Vector_ScalarSurfaceIntegral.html#task-245" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
