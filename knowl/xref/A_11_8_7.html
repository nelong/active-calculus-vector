<li><div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> measures the distance from the origin to a point, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(\rho = 1\)</span> is the set of all points that are a distance 1 from the origin. This makes <span class="process-math">\(\rho=1\)</span> the equation of the sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">All points with <span class="process-math">\(\phi = \frac{\pi}{3}\)</span> are at a fixed angle from the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis.

<li><div class="para">As in cylindrical coordinates, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(\theta = 2\)</span> is a plane through the origin perpendicular to the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane making an angle of 2 radians with the <span class="process-math">\(xz\)</span>-plane. With <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq \rho \leq 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq \phi \leq \pi\text{,}\)</span> we obtain a semicircle or radius 1 centered at the origin in this plane.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For a fixed value of <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> the graph of <span class="process-math">\(\rho=\theta\)</span> is an intersection of a sphere of radius <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> centered at the origin with a plane through the origin. If <span class="process-math">\(0 \leq \phi \leq \pi\text{,}\)</span> then we get a semicircle. As <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> increases from <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(2\pi\text{,}\)</span> the radii of the semicircles increase, leaving us with a surface that looks like a snail shell.</div></li>
