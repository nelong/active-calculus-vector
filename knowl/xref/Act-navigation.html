<div class="introduction"><div class="para">In this problem we will be navigating to help find a friend who is lost at a local state park.

<div class="para">Your friend told you they would be staying 3 km east and 4 km north of the main parking lot. You drive to the parking lot and park next to your friend’s car, then hike 3 km east and 4 km north. You get to the location you expected your friend to be at, but you don’t find your friend and call the ranger station. The ranger station says they think your friend is 1 km west and 4 km north of your current location.</div> <div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> be the vector that represents your hike from your car to the expected location of your friend, <span class="process-math">\(\vv\)</span> be the vector that represents the vector from your current location to the ranger’s suggested location, and <span class="process-math">\(\vw\)</span> be the vector from your car to the ranger’s suggested location.

<div class="para">After hiking to the location suggested by the ranger, you still don’t see your friend and call the ranger station again. The regional manager of rangers answers this time and says the first ranger made a mistake in their navigation. A drone spotted your friend along the same direction from your car to your current location but your friend is three times as far away you are from your car. In order to avoid confusion or any other mistakes, you want to compute the vector from your car to the drone’s suggested location, which we will call <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> What are the components of <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{CD}\)</span> and how does that compare to <span class="process-math">\(\vw\text{?}\)</span>

<div class="para">After hiking to the drone’s suggested location, you find your friend. Yay! On the walk back to your car with your friend, you decide to help make sure the first ranger understands vectors; in particular, you want to let them know what direction they should have told you to go from <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Use the components of <span class="process-math">\(\overrightarrow{CD}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\vu\)</span> to figure what the first ranger should have told you.</div></article></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="S-Precalc-Vectors.html#Act-navigation">in-context</a></span>
