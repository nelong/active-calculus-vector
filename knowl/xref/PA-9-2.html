<div class="para">Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to specify how to generate text or graphics. The following is a simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,-1)\text{:}\)</span>
</div>
<pre class="code-display tex2jax_ignore"> 
              (0,0) moveto 
              (1,1) lineto stroke
              (1,-1) lineto stroke
              (0,0) lineto stroke
            </pre>
<div class="para">The process described by these commands is 1) tell Postscript to start at the point <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\text{,}\)</span> 2) draw a line from the point <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> (this is what the line to and stroke commands do), then 3) draw lines from <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\((1,-1)\)</span> and 4) <span class="process-math">\((1,-1)\)</span> back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair <span class="process-math">\(\langle x, y \rangle\)</span> (this pair <span class="process-math">\(\langle x, y \rangle\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">vector</dfn>), where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the horizontal displacement and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> is represented by <span class="process-math">\(\langle 1,1 \rangle\)</span> but the vector from the point <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> to the origin is represented by <span class="process-math">\(\langle -1,-1 \rangle\text{.}\)</span>
