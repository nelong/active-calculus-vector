<div class="para">According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by “girth” we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. Our goal is to find the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail. (We solved this applied optimization problem in single variable <em class="emphasis">Active Calculus</em>, so it may look familiar. We take a different approach in this section, and this approach allows us to view most applied optimization problems from single variable calculus as constrained optimization problems, as well as provide us tools to solve a greater variety of optimization problems.) If we let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be the length of the side of one square end of the package and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> the length of the package, then we want to maximize the volume <span class="process-math">\(f(x,y) = x^2y\)</span> of the box subject to the constraint that the girth (<span class="process-math">\(4x\)</span>) plus the length (<span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) is as large as possible, or <span class="process-math">\(4x+y = 108\text{.}\)</span> The equation <span class="process-math">\(4x + y = 108\)</span> is thus an external constraint on the variables.</div> <ol class="lower-alpha" id="PA_10_8-1-2">
