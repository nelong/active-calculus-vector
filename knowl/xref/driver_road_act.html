<div class="introduction"><div class="para">In this activity, we want to determine if the different measurements that are described are a property of the driver or the road. A measurement is a property of the driver if the value(s) of that measurement <em class="alert">can</em> be different for different drivers (when measured at the same location on the racetrack). A measurement is a property of the road when different drivers <em class="alert">must</em> have the same value(s) (when measured at the same location on the racetrack).</div></div>
