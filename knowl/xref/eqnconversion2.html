<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In this example, we will convert the equation <span class="process-math">\(r=3\cos(\theta)\)</span> into rectangular coordinates, identify the shape of its graph, and plot the graph of this equation. Remember that we do not have explicit conversion equations for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> but we do have some equations, like <span class="process-math">\(r^2=x^2+y^2\)</span> which will allow us to convert to an expression in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that does not require intepretation. Let’s try to square both sides of our polar equation, since this will give us an expression on the left hand side of the equation that will be easy to conver to rectangular coordinates.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
r =3\cos(\theta) \Rightarrow r^2=9 (\cos(\theta))^2 \Rightarrow x^2+y^2 = 9  (\cos(\theta))^2 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Our last equation is a mix of rectangular and polar coordinates so we are not done with our coversion to rectangular (just <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>) coordinates. Unfortunately the easiest way to convert <span class="process-math">\((\cos(\theta))^2\)</span> to rectangular is to use</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
x=r \cos(\theta) \Rightarrow (\cos(\theta))^2=\frac{x^2}{r^2} \Rightarrow (\cos(\theta))^2=\frac{x^2}{x^2+y^2} 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which will give us a rational expression for our conversion. This wil require some extra algebra and interpretation, so let’s try a slightly different approach. Instead of squaring both sides of our polar equation, what if we multiply both sides by <span class="process-math">\(r\text{.}\)</span> You may have seen this as a better approach from the start or gained this insight after our work above. Remember, there are multiple paths to insight and being able to incorporate new ideas and information to form new strategies is a vital skill to solving interesting and realistic problems. So, if we multiple both sides of our original equation by <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> then we get</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
r =3\cos(\theta) \Rightarrow r^2=3 r \cos(\theta) 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This equation is great because both the left and right hand sides have conversions to rectangular coordinates that do NOT require interpretation or cases. So, the <span class="process-math">\((r,\theta)\)</span> points that satisfy <span class="process-math">\(r = 3 cos(\theta)\)</span> are the same locations as the <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> points that satisfy <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2=3x\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We have now converted our polar equation to a rectangular equation. What shape will the graph of <span class="process-math">\(x^2+y^2=3x\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(r = 3 cos(\theta)\)</span>) be? A translated circle that we can do some algebra (complete the square technique) to put into the the standard form of a circle (<span class="process-math">\((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = R^2\)</span>).</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
x+y^2=3x  \amp\Rightarrow \amp x -3x \amp \amp +y^2 \amp=0  \\
\amp \amp x -3x \amp+\frac{9}{4} \amp +y^2 \amp=0+\frac{9}{4}\\
\amp \amp (x -\frac{3}{2})^2 \amp \amp +(y-0)^2 \amp=\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">We can see now that this circle will have center <span class="process-math">\((\frac{3}{2},0)\)</span> and radius <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{2}\text{.}\)</span> The graph of <span class="process-math">\(r =3\cos(\theta)\)</span> is the same as <span class="process-math">\(x+y^2=3x\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\((x -\frac{3}{2})^2  +(y-0)^2 =\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2\)</span> which has the graph</div>
