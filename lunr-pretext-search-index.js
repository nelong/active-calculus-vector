  "title": "Features of the Text",
  "body": " Features of the Text  Similar to the presentation of the single-variable Active Calculus , instructors and students alike will find several consistent features in the presentation, including:   Motivating Questions.  At the start of each section, we list motivating questions that provide motivation for why the following material is of interest to us. One goal of each section is to answer each of the motivating questions.    Preview Activities.  Each section of the text begins with a short introduction, followed by a preview activity . This brief reading and the preview activity are designed to foreshadow the upcoming ideas in the remainder of the section; both the reading and preview activity are intended to be accessible to students in advance of class, and indeed to be completed by students before a day on which a particular section is to be considered.    Activities.  Every section in the text contains several activities . These are designed to engage students in an inquiry-based style that encourages them to construct solutions to key examples on their own, working either individually or in small groups.    Exercises.  There are dozens of calculus texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat a large list of standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the National Problem Library and its many multivariable calculus problems. In this text, each section begins with several anonymous WeBWorK exercises, and follows with several challenging problems. The WeBWorK exercises are best completed in the .html version of the text . Almost every non- WeBWorK problem has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings. For instructors interested in a more conventional source of exercises, consider the freely available APEX Calculus text by Greg Hartmann et al.    Graphics.  As much as possible, we strive to demonstrate key fundamental ideas visually, and to encourage students to do the same. Throughout the text, we use full-color graphics to exemplify and magnify key ideas, and to use this graphical perspective alongside both numerical and algebraic representations of calculus. When the text itself refers to color in images, one needs to view the .html or .pdf electronically. The figures and the software to generate them have been created by David Austin.    Summary of Key Ideas.  Each section concludes with a summary of the key ideas encountered in the preceding section; this summary normally reflects responses to the motivating questions that began the section.    Links to technological tools.  Many of the ideas of multivariable calculus are best understood dynamically, and we encourage readers to make frequent use of technology to analyze graphs and data. Since technology changes so often, we refrain from indicating specific programs to use in the text. However, aside from computer algebra systems like Maple , Mathematics , or Sage , there are many free graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces or curves. These programs can be used by instructors and students to assist in the investigations and demonstrations. The use of these freely available applets is in accord with our philosophy that no one should be required to purchase materials to learn calculus. We are indebted to everyone who allows their expertise to be openly shared. Below is a list of a few of the technological tools that are available (links active at the writing of this edition). Of course, you can find your own by searching the web.       Wolfram Alpha , useful for graphing surfaces in 2D and 3D, and for general calculations     Wolfram Alpha widgets , searchable site for simple to use programs using Wolfram Alpha     GeoGebra , all purpose graphing tool with some computer algebra capabilities. Clicking on the magnifying glass icon allows you to search a large database of GeoGebra applets.     CalcPlot3D , good all-purpose 3D graphing tool     A collection of Flash Mathlets for graphing surfaces, parametric curves in 3D, spherical coordinates and other 3D tools. Requires Flash Player.

  "title": "Vector Calculus Preface",
  "body": " Vector Calculus Preface  We are glad to have the opportunity to contribute the chapter on to expand Active Calculus - Multivariable . This chapter is currently in draft form , but ready for testing. We have tried to adhere to the style of the Active Calculus series of texts as much as possible. Sections begin with Motivating Questions and end with a summary that answers those questions. Each section has a preview activity and several activities intended for classroom use.  Recognizing that not all institutions will cover all the material in this chapter, we have intended that the overview of vector fields, line integrals of vector fields, and ( ) can be combined with on . We would encourage you to explore the section on curl before proceeding to , but only the first portion on circulation density would be terribly beneficial. does make some passing backward references to the development of divergence in , but it is not necessary to cover divergence in order to do the basics of circulation density and then .  Observant faculty may notice that the graphics in our chapter deviate from those in the previous 11. Because so much of vector calculus relies upon visualizing things in three dimensions, we elected to produce almost all of the graphics using SageMath. This allows for a degree of consistency between the two-dimensional graphics, which are typically static, and the three-dimensional graphics, which are almost always interactive. Thus, you can grab a three-dimensional plot, rotate it, zoom in on it, etc.  To rotate a three-dimensional graphic, click and drag with your mouse.  To zoom on an interactive three-dimensional graphic, use your mouse's scroll wheel or make your operating system's scroll gesture on your touchpad.  To move a three-dimensional graphic instead of rotating, hold down the space bar while clicking and dragging.    Notice that is a work in progress in a few ways:  Answers and solutions to many activities are not yet written.   WeBWorK exercises have not yet been added.  Some sections lack exercises altogether.  Sections on line integrals and surface integrals of scalar functions are yet to be added.  We welcome suggestions of WeBWorK exercises that faculty think would be good inclusions as well as suggestions for exercise topics. We also welcome feedback on any aspect of this chapter. We have set up a Google Form to collect feedback. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has delayed a final release of these materials. Perhaps by August 2022, they will be ready in a complete, public form, but we hope you continue to find them useful until then.   Mitchel T.

  "title": "Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals",
  "body": " Active Calculus - Multivariable: our goals  Several fundamental ideas in calculus are more than 2000 years old. As a formal subdiscipline of mathematics, calculus was first introduced and developed in the late 1600s, with key independent contributions from Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Mathematicians agree that the subject has been understood rigorously since the work of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass in the mid 1800s when the field of modern analysis was developed, in part to make sense of the infinitely small quantities on which calculus rests. As a body of knowledge, calculus has been completely understood for at least 150 years. The discipline is one of our great human intellectual achievements: among many spectacular ideas, calculus models how objects fall under the forces of gravity and wind resistance, explains how to compute areas and volumes of interesting shapes, enables us to work rigorously with infinitely small and infinitely large quantities, and connects the varying rates at which quantities change to the total change in the quantities themselves.  While each author of a calculus textbook certainly offers their own creative perspective on the subject, it is hardly the case that many of the ideas an author presents are new. Indeed, the mathematics community broadly agrees on what the main ideas of calculus are, as well as their justification and their importance; the core parts of nearly all calculus textbooks are very similar. As such, it is our opinion that in the 21st century an age where the internet permits seamless and immediate transmission of information no one should be required to purchase a calculus text to read, to use for a class, or to find a coherent collection of problems to solve. Calculus belongs to humankind, not any individual author or publishing company. Thus, a main purpose of this work is to present a new multivariable calculus text that is free . In addition, instructors who are looking for a calculus text should have the opportunity to download the source files and make modifications that they see fit; thus this text is open-source .  In Active Calculus - Multivariable , we endeavor to actively engage students in learning the subject through an activity-driven approach in which the vast majority of the examples are completed by students. Where many texts present a general theory of calculus followed by substantial collections of worked examples, we instead pose problems or situations, consider possibilities, and then ask students to investigate and explore. Following key activities or examples, the presentation normally includes some overall perspective and a brief synopsis of general trends or properties, followed by formal statements of rules or theorems. While we often offer plausibility arguments for such results, rarely do we include formal proofs. It is not the intent of this text for the instructor or author to demonstrate to students that the ideas of calculus are coherent and true, but rather for students to encounter these ideas in a supportive, leading manner that enables them to begin to understand for themselves why calculus is both coherent and true.  This approach is consistent with the following goals:   To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners strive to construct solutions and approaches to ideas on their own, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.    To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in multivariable calculus are natural and true. We strive to accomplish this by using specific cases to highlight the ideas for the general situation using contexts that are common and familiar.    To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of multivariable calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, through working on activities in small groups in class, and through doing substantial exercises outside of class time.    To strengthen students' written and oral communication skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of multivariable calculus.     "

  "title": "How to Use this Text",
  "body": " How to Use this Text  Because the text is free, any professor or student may use the electronic version of the text for no charge. For reading on laptops or mobile devices, the best electronic version to use is the .html version of the text , but you can find links to a pdf and hard copy of the text at https:\/\/activecalculus.org\/ . Furthermore, because the text is open-source, any instructor may acquire the full set of source files, which are available on GitHub .  This text may be used as a stand-alone textbook for a standard multivariable calculus course or as a supplement to a more traditional text. Chapter introduces functions of several independent variables along with tools that will be used to study these functions, namely vectors and vector-valued functions. Chapter studies differentiation of functions of several independent variables in detail, addressing the typical topics including limits, partial derivatives, and optimization, while Chapter provides the standard topics of integration of multivariable functions.     Electronic Edition  Because students and instructors alike have access to the book in electronic format, there are several advantages to the text over a traditional print text. One is that the text may be projected on a screen in the classroom (or even better, on a whiteboard) and the instructor may reference ideas in the text directly, add comments or notation or features to graphs, and indeed write right on the projected text itself. Students can do the same when working at the board. In addition, students can choose to print only whatever portions of the text are needed for them. Also, the electronic versions of the text includes live .html links to on-line programs, so student and instructor alike may follow those links to additional resources that lie outside the text itself. Finally, students can have access to a copy of the text anywhere they have a computer. The .html version is far superior to the .pdf version; this is especially true for viewing on a smartphone.   Note. In the .pdf version, there is not an obvious visual indicator of the live .html links, so some availalable information is suppressed. If you are using the text electronically in a setting with internet access, please know that it is assumed you are using the .html version.    Activities Workbook  Each section of the text has a preview activity and at least three in-class activities embedded in the discussion. As it is the expectation that students will complete all of these activities, it is ideal for them to have room to work on them adjacent to the problem statements themselves. A separate workbook of activities that includes only the individual activity prompts, along with space provided for students to write their responses, is in development.    Community of Users  Because this text is free and open-source, we hope that as people use the text, they will contribute corrections, suggestions, and new material. At this time, the best way to communicate such feedback is by email to Steve Schlicker at schlicks@gvsu.edu .     "

  "title": "Functions of Several Variables and Three Dimensional Space",
  "body": " Functions of Several Variables and Three Dimensional Space     What is a function of several variables? What do we mean by the domain of a function of several variables?    How do we find the distance between two points in ? What is the equation of a sphere in ?    What is a trace of a function of two variables? What does a trace tell us about a function?    What is a level curve of a function of two variables? What does a level curve tell us about a function?      Throughout our mathematical careers we have studied functions of a single variable. We define a function of one variable as a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. We analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. Functions of several variables will be the main focus of Chapters 10 and 11, where we will analyze these functions by looking at their graphs, calculating limits, differentiating, integrating, and more. We will see that many of the ideas from single variable calculus translate well to functions of several variables, but we will have to make some adjustments as well. In this chapter we introduce functions of several variables and then discuss some of the tools (vectors and vector-valued functions) that will help us understand and analyze functions of several variables.   Suppose you invest money in an account that pays 5% interest compounded continuously. If you invest dollars in the account, the amount of money in the account after years is given by   The variables and are independent of each other, so using functional notation we write    Find the amount of money in the account after 7 years if you originally invest 1000 dollars.    Evaluate . Explain in words what this calculation represents.    Now consider only the situation where the amount invested is fixed at 1000 dollars.

Calculate the amount of money in the account as indicated in Table . Round payments to the nearest penny.  Amount of money in an account after 10 years.    Initial investment (dollars)  500  1000  5000  7500  10000    Amount (dollars)             Describe as best you can the combinations of initial investments and time that result in an account containing $10,000.        Functions of Several Variables  Up to this point we have been concerned with functions of a single variable. What defined such a function is that every input in the domain produced a unique output in the range. We saw similar behavior in Preview Activity , where each pair of inputs produces a unique output . Additionally, the two variables and had no real relation to each other. That is, we could choose any value of without considering what value might have, and we could select any value of to use without regard to what value might have. For that reason we say that the variables and are independent of each other. Thus, we call a function of the two independent variables and . This is the key idea in defining a function of two independent variables.    A function of two independent variables function of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair in some set exactly one real number .    There is, of course, no reason to restrict ourselves to functions of only two variables we can use any number of variables we like. For example, defines as a function of the three variables , , and . In general, a function of independent variables is a rule that assigns to an ordered -tuple in some set exactly one real number.  As with functions of a single variable, it is important to understand the set of inputs for which the function is defined.    The domain function domain of a function is the set of all inputs at which the function is defined.     Identify the domain of each of the following functions. Draw a picture of each domain in the -plane.                           Representing Functions of Two Variables  One of the techniques we use to study functions of one variable is to create a table of values. We can do the same for functions of two variables, except that our tables will have to allow us to keep track of both input variables. We can do this with a 2-dimensional table, where we list the -values down the first column and the -values across the first row. As an example, suppose we launch a projectile, using a golf club, a cannon, or some other device, from ground level. Under ideal conditions (ignoring wind resistance, spin, or any other forces except the force of gravity) the horizontal distance the object will travel depends on the initial velocity the object is given, and the angle at which it is launched. If we let represent the horizontal distance the object travels, then is a function of the two variables and , and we represent in functional notation by where is the acceleration due to gravity. (Note that is constant, 32 feet per second squared. We will derive this equation in a later section.) To create a table of values for , we list the -values down the first column and the -values across the first row. The value is then displayed in the location where the row intersects the column, as shown in Table (where we measure in feet per second and in radians).   Values of .              25  7.6  14.0  18.2  19.5  17.8  13.2  6.5    50  30.4  56.0  72.8  78.1  71.0   26.2    75  68.4   163.8  175.7  159.8  118.7  58.9    100  121.7  224.2  291.3  312.4  284.2  211.1  104.7    125  190.1  350.3  455.1   444.0  329.8  163.6    150  273.8  504.4  655.3  702.8  639.3  474.9  235.5    175  372.7  686.5  892.0  956.6  870.2  646.4     200  486.8  896.7  1165.0  1249.5  1136.6  844.3  418.7    225  616.2  1134.9  1474.5  1581.4  1438.5  1068.6  530.0    250  760.6  1401.1   1952.3  1776.0  1319.3  654.3      Complete Table by filling in the missing values of the function . Round entries to the nearest tenth.   If is a function of a single variable , then we define the graph of to be the set of points of the form , where is in the domain of . We then plot these points using the coordinate axes in order to visualize the graph. We can do a similar thing with functions of several variables. Table identifies points of the form , and we define the graph of to be the set of these points.    The graph function graph of a function is the set of points of the form , where the point is in the domain of .    We also often refer to the graph of a function of two variables as the surface function surface generated by . Points in the form are in three dimensions, so plotting these points takes a bit more work than graphs of functions in two dimensions. To plot these three-dimensional points, we need to set up a coordinate system with three mutually perpendicular axes the -axis, the -axis, and the -axis (called the coordinate axes ). There are essentially two different ways we could set up a 3D coordinate system, as shown in Figure ; thus, before we can proceed, we need to establish a convention.   Left: A left hand system. Right: A right hand system       The distinction between these two figures is subtle, but important. In the coordinate system shown at left in Figure , imagine that you are sitting on the positive -axis next to the label . Looking down at the - and -axes, you see that the -axis is obtained by rotating the -axis by 90 in the clockwise direction. Again sitting on the positive -axis in the coordinate system at right in Figure , you see that the -axis is obtained by rotating the -axis by 90 in the counterclockwise direction.  We call the coordinate system at right in a right-hand system ; if we point the index finger of our right hand along the positive -axis and our middle finger along the positive -axis, then our thumb points in the direction of the positive -axis. Following mathematical conventions, we choose to use a right-hand system throughout this book.  Now that we have established a convention for a right-hand system, we can draw a graph of the distance function defined by . Note that the function is continuous in both variables, so when we plot these points in the right hand coordinate system, we can connect them all to form a surface in 3-space. The graph of the distance function is shown in Figure .   The distance surface.    There are many graphing tools available for drawing three-dimensional surfaces as indicated in the Preface (see Links to interactive graphics in Features of the Text). Since we will be able to visualize graphs of functions of two independent variables, but not functions of more than two variables, we will primarily deal with functions of two variables in this text. It is important to note, however, that the techniques we develop apply to functions of any number of variables.   Notation: We let denote the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers in the plane (two copies of the real number system) and let represent the set of all ordered triples of real numbers (which constitutes three-space).    Some Standard Equations in Three-Space  In addition to graphing functions, we will also want to understand graphs of some simple equations in three dimensions. For example, in , the graphs of the equations and , where and are constants, are lines parallel to the coordinate axes. In the next activity we consider their three-dimensional analogs.     Consider the set of points that satisfy the equation . Describe this set as best you can.    Consider the set of points that satisfy the equation . Describe this set as best you can.    Consider the set of points that satisfy the equation . Describe this set as best you can.      Activity shows that the equations where one independent variable is constant lead to planes parallel to ones that result from a pair of the coordinate axes. When we make the constant 0, we get the coordinate planes coordinate planes . The -plane satisfies , the -plane satisfies , and the -plane satisfies (see Figure ).   The coordinate planes.        On a related note, we define a circle in as the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point. In , we call the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point a sphere sphere definition . To find the equation of a sphere, we need to understand how to calculate the distance between two points in three-space, and we explore this idea in the next activity.    Let and be two points in . These two points form opposite vertices of a rectangular box whose sides are planes parallel to the coordinate planes as illustrated in Figure , and the distance between and is the length of the blue diagonal shown in Figure .   The distance formula in .       Consider the right triangle in the base of the box whose hypotenuse is shown as the red line in Figure . What are the coordinates of the vertices of this triangle? Since this right triangle lies in a plane, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a formula for the length of the hypotenuse of this triangle. Find such a formula, which will be in terms of , , , and .    Now notice that the triangle whose hypotenuse is the blue segment connecting the points and with a leg as the hypotenuse of the triangle found in part (a) lies entirely in a plane, so we can again use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of its hypotenuse. Explain why the length of this hypotenuse, which is the distance between the points and , is      The formula developed in Activity is important to remember.   The distance between points  The distance between points and (denoted as ) in is given by the formula    Equation can be used to derive the formula for a sphere sphere formula centered at a point with radius . Since the distance from any point on such a sphere to the point is , the point will satisfy the equation   Squaring both sides, we come to the standard equation for a sphere.   The equation of a sphere  The equation of a sphere with center and radius is    This makes sense if we compare this equation to its two-dimensional analogue, the equation of a circle of radius in the plane centered at :     Traces  When we study functions of several variables we are often interested in how each individual variable affects the function in and of itself. In Preview Activity , we saw that the amount of money in an account depends on the amount initially invested and the duration of the investment. However, if we fix the initial investment, the amount of money in the account depends only on the duration of the investment, and if we set the duration of the investment constant, then the amount of money in the account depends only on the initial investment. This idea of keeping one variable constant while we allow the other to change will be an important tool for us when studying functions of several variables.  As another example, consider again the distance function defined by where is the initial velocity of an object in feet per second, is the launch angle in radians, and is the acceleration due to gravity (32 feet per second squared). If we hold the launch angle constant at radians, we can consider a function of the initial velocity alone. In this case we have   We can plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when , as shown at left in Figure . The formula clearly shows that is quadratic in the -direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch velocity while keeping the launch angle constant, the horizontal distance the object travels increases proportional to the square of the initial velocity.  Similarly, if we fix the initial velocity at 150 feet per second, we can consider the distance as a function of the launch angle only. In this case we have   We can again plot this curve on the surface by tracing out the points on the surface when , as shown at right in Figure . The formula clearly show that is sinusoidal in the -direction. More descriptively, as we increase the launch angle while keeping the initial velocity constant, the horizontal distance traveled by the object is proportional to the sine of twice the launch angle.   Left: The trace with . Right: The trace with .       The curves we define when we fix one of the independent variables in our two variable function are called traces .    A trace trace of a function of two independent variables and in the direction is a curve of the form , where is a constant. Similarly, a trace of a function of two independent variables and in the direction is a curve of the form , where is a constant.    Understanding trends in the behavior of functions of two variables can be challenging, as can sketching their graphs; traces help us with each of these tasks.   In the following questions, we investigate the use of traces to better understand a function through both tables and graphs.   Identify the trace for the distance function defined by by highlighting or circling the appropriate cells in Table . Write a sentence to describe the behavior of the function along this trace.    Identify the trace for the distance function by highlighting or circling the appropriate cells in Table . Write a sentence to describe the behavior of the function along this trace.  Coordinate axes to sketch traces.       For the function defined by , explain the type of function that each trace in the direction will be (keeping constant). Plot the , , , , and traces in 3-dimensional coordinate system provided in Figure .    For the function defined by , explain the type of function that each trace in the direction will be (keeping constant). Plot the , , , , and traces in 3-dimensional coordinate system in Figure .    Describe the surface generated by the function .        Contour Maps and Level Curves  We have all seen topographic maps such as the one of the Porcupine Mountains in the upper peninsula of Michigan shown in Figure . Map source: Michigan Department of Natural Resources, with permission of the Michigan DNR and Bob Wild. The curves on these maps show the regions of constant altitude. The contours also depict changes in altitude: contours that are close together signify steep ascents or descents, while contours that are far apart indicate only slight changes in elevation. Thus, contour maps tell us a lot about three-dimensional surfaces. Mathematically, if represents the altitude at the point , then each contour is the graph of an equation of the form , for some constant .   Contour map of the Porcupine Mountains.     On the topographical map of the Porcupine Mountains in Figure ,   identify the highest and lowest points you can find;    from a point of your choice, determine a path of steepest ascent that leads to the highest point;    from that same initial point, determine the least steep path that leads to the highest point.      Curves on a surface that describe points at the same height or level are called level curves .    A level curve level curve (or contour) of a function of two independent variables and is a curve of the form , where is a constant.    Topographical maps can be used to create a three-dimensional surface from the two-dimensional contours or level curves. For example, level curves of the distance function defined by plotted in the -plane are shown at left in Figure . If we lift these contours and plot them at their respective heights, then we get a picture of the surface itself, as illustrated at right in Figure .   Left: Level curves. Right: Level curves at appropriate heights.       The use of level curves and traces can help us construct the graph of a function of two variables.    Left: Level curves for .

Explain what the surface defined by looks like.    Compare and contrast the graphs of and . How are they alike? How are they different? Use traces for each function to help answer these questions.     The traces and level curves of a function of two variables are curves in space. In order to understand these traces and level curves better, we will first spend some time learning about vectors and vector-valued functions in the next few sections and return to our study of functions of several variables once we have those more mathematical tools to support their study.    A gallery of functions  We end this section by considering a collection of functions and illustrating their graphs and some level curves.                                                     Summary    A function of several variables is a rule that assigns a unique number to an ordered collection of independent inputs. The domain of a function of several variables is the set of all inputs for which the function is defined.    In , the distance between points and (denoted as ) is given by the formula and thus the equation of a sphere with center and radius is     A trace of a function of two independent variables and is a curve of the form or , where is a constant. A trace tells us how the function depends on a single independent variable if we treat the other independent variable as a constant.    A level curve of a function of two independent variables and is a curve of the form , where is a constant. A level curve describes the set of inputs that lead to a specific output of the function.        Evaluate the function at the specified points.   At :  At :  At :                  to find . Similarly, with we find . Finally, for we find .        Sketch a contour diagram of each function. Then, decide whether its contours are predominantly lines, parabolas, ellipses, or hyperbolas.                 SOLUTION  1. The contours have equation , which represent hyperbolas in the - plane.  2. The contours have equation , which (for ) represent ellipses in the - plane.  3. The contours have equation , which represent parabolas in the - plane.  4. The contours have equation . For , these equations are equivalent to , which represent vertical lines in the - plane.         Match the surfaces with the verbal description of the level curves by placing the letter of the verbal description to the left of the number of the surface.                          a collection of unequally spaced concentric circles    a collection of unequally spaced parallel lines    a collection of equally spaced concentric circles    two straight lines and a collection of hyperbolas    a collection of concentric ellipses    a collection of equally spaced parallel lines           The domain of the function is    A         Find the equation of the sphere centered at with radius 3.

For each surface, decide whether it could be a bowl, a plate, or neither. Consider a plate to be any fairly flat surface and a bowl to be anything that could hold water, assuming the positive z-axis is up.                          Consider the concentration, C, (in mg\/liter) of a drug in the blood as a function of the amount of drug given, x, and the time since injection, t. For mg and hours, we have    Give a practical interpretation of your answer: is   the concentration of a 3 mg dose in the blood 2 hours after injection.    the amount of a 2 mg dose in the blood 3 hours after injection.    the amount of a 3 mg dose in the blood 2 hours after injection.    the concentration of a 2 mg dose in the blood 3 hours after injection.    the change in concentration of a 3 mg dose in the blood 2 hours after injection.    the change in concentration of a 2 mg dose in the blood 3 hours after injection.                A manufacturer sells aardvark masks at a price of $140 per mask and butterfly masks at a price of $570 per mask. A quantity of a aardvark masks and b butterfly masks is sold at a total cost of $600 to the manufacturer.  (a) Express the manufacturer's profit, P , as a function of a and b .   dollars.  (b) The curves of constant profit in the ab-plane are   circles    hyperbolas    ellipses    lines    parabolas                Consider the concentration, , in mg per liter (L), of a drug in the blood as a function of , the amount, in mg, of the drug given and , the time in hours since the injection. For and , we have .  Graph the following two single variable functions on a separate page, being sure that you can explain their significance in terms of drug concentration.  (a)   (b)   Using your graph in (a) , where is  a maximum?   a minimum?   Using your graph in (b) , where is  a maximum?   a minimum?                        (a) Holding fixed at 2 means that we are considering an injection of 2 mg of the drug; letting vary means we are watching the effect of this dose as time passes. Thus the function describes the concentration of the drug in the blood resulting from a 2 mg injection as a function of time. The figure below shows the graph of . Notice that the concentration in the blood from this dose is at a maximum at 0.333333 hour after injection, and that the concentration in the blood eventually approaches zero. The initial concentration is 0, so the minimum occurs at .  (b) Holding fixed at 3.5 means that we are focusing on the blood 3.5 hours after the injection; letting vary means we are considering the effect of different doses at that instant. Thus, the function gives the concentration of the drug in the blood 3.5 hours after injection as a function of the amount injected. The figure below shows the graph of . Notice that is an increasing function of . This makes sense: If we administer more of the drug, the concentration in the bloodstream is higher. In particular, this means that the maximum concentration occurs at the maximum value of , 4, and the minimum at .

The Ideal Gas Law, , relates the pressure ( , in pascals), temperature ( , in Kelvin), and volume ( , in cubic meters) of 1 mole of a gas ( is the universal gas constant), and describes the behavior of gases that do not liquefy easily, such as oxygen and hydrogen. We can solve the ideal gas law for the volume and hence treat the volume as a function of the pressure and temperature:    Explain in detail what the trace of with tells us about a key relationship between two quantities.

Based on all your work above, write a couple of sentences that describe the effects that temperature and pressure have on volume.       When people buy a large ticket item like a car or a house, they often take out a loan to make the purchase. The loan is paid back in monthly installments until the entire amount of the loan, plus interest, is paid. The monthly payment that the borrower has to make depends on the amount of money borrowed (called the principal), the duration of the loan in years, and the interest rate . For example, if we borrow $18,000 to buy a car, the monthly payment that we need to make to pay off the loan is given by the formula    Find the monthly payments on this loan if the interest rate is 6% and the duration of the loan is 5 years.

  "body": " Vectors     What is a vector?    What does it mean for two vectors to be equal?    How do we add two vectors together and multiply a vector by a scalar?    How do we determine the magnitude of a vector? What is a unit vector, and how do we find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector?      Quantities like length, speed, area, and mass are all measured by numbers (called scalars ). Other quantities, like velocity, force, and displacement, have two attributes: magnitude and direction. These quantities are represented by vectors and are the study of this section. For example, we will use vectors to calculate work done by a constant force, calculate torque, determine direction vectors for lines and normal vectors for planes, define curvature, and determine the direction of greatest increase on a surface. For most of these applications, we will be interested in using vectors to measure direction and\/or speed. Vectors will be a major tool for us in determining the behavior of functions of several variables.  If we are at a point in the domain of a function of one variable, there are only two directions in which we can move: in the positive or negative -direction. If, however, we are at a point in the domain of a function of two variables, there are many directions in which we can move. Thus, it is important for us to have a means to indicate direction, and we will do so using vectors. This notion of direction in space will be critical for us to find direction vectors for lines, tangent lines to curves, normal vectors to planes, and to determine direction of motion.   Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to describe the appearance of text or graphics. A simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices , , and is the following: (0,0) moveto (1,1) lineto stroke (1,-1) lineto stroke (0,0) lineto stroke The key idea in these commands is that we start at the origin, then tell Postscript that we want to start at the point , draw a line from the point to the point (this is what the lineto and stroke commands do), then draw lines from to and back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair (this pair is a vector ), where is the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point is represented by the vector .   What is the vector that describes the displacement from the point to the point ? How can we use this vector to determine the distance from the point to the point ?    Suppose we want to draw the triangle with vertices , , and . As a shorthand notation, we will denote the vector from the point to the point as    Determine the vectors , , and .    What relationship do you see among the vectors , , and ? Explain why this relationship should hold.           Representations of Vectors   Preview Activity shows how we can record the magnitude and direction of a change in position using an ordered pair of numbers . There are many other quantities, such as force and velocity, that possess the attributes of magnitude and direction, and we will call each such quantity a vector .    A vector vector definition is a quantity that possesses the attributes of magnitude and direction.    We can represent a vector geometrically as a directed line segment, with the magnitude as the length of the segment and an arrowhead indicating direction, as shown at left in Figure .   Left: A vector. Right: Representations of the same vector.       According to the definition, a vector possesses the attributes of length (magnitude) and direction; the vector's position, however, is not mentioned. Consequently, we regard as equal any two vectors having the same magnitude and direction, as shown at right in Figure . In other words, two vectors are equal provided they have the same magnitude and direction.  This means that the same vector may be drawn in the plane in many different ways. For instance, suppose that we would like to draw the vector , which represents a horizontal change of three units and a vertical change of four units. We may place the tail of the vector (the point from which the vector originates) at the origin and the tip (the terminal point of the vector) at , as illustrated at left in Figure . A vector with its tail at the origin is said to be in standard position .   Left: Standard position. Right: A vector between two points.       Alternatively, we may place the tail of the vector at another point, such as . After a displacement of three units to the right and four units up, the tip of the vector is at the point (see the vector at right in Figure ).  In this example, the vector led to the directed line segment from to , which we denote as . We may also turn the situation around: given the two points and , we obtain the vector because we move horizontally three units and vertically four units to get from to . In other words, . In general, the vector from the point to is found by taking the difference of coordinates, so that   We will use boldface letters to represent vectors, such as , to distinguish them from scalars. The entries of a vector are called its components ; in the vector , the component is 3 and the component is 4. We use pointed brackets and the term components to distinguish a vector from a point and its coordinates . There is, however, a close connection between vectors and points. Given a point , we will frequently consider the vector from the origin to . For instance, if , then as in Figure . In this way, we think of a point as defining a vector whose components agree with the coordinates of . The vector is called the position vector position vector of .   A point defines a vector    While we often illustrate vectors in the plane since it is easier to draw pictures, different situations call for the use of vectors in three or more dimensions. For instance, a vector in -dimensional space, , has components and may be represented as   The next activity will help us to become accustomed to vectors and operations on vectors in three dimensions.   An article by C.Kenneth Tanner of the University of Georgia argues that, due to the concept of social distance, a secondary school classroom for 20 students should have 1344 square feet of floor space. Suppose a classroom is 32 feet by 42 feet by 8 feet. Set the origin of the classroom to be its center. In this classroom, a student is sitting on a chair whose seat is at location , an overhead projector is located at position , and the teacher is standing at point , all distances measured in feet. Determine the components of the indicated vectors and explain in context what each represents.     a.  b.  c.  d.  e.  f.        Equality of Vectors  Because location is not mentioned in the definition of a vector, any two vectors that have the same magnitude and direction are equal. It is helpful to have an algebraic way to determine when this occurs. That is, if we know the components of two vectors and , we will want to be able to determine algebraically when and are equal. There is an obvious set of conditions that we use.   Equality of Vectors  Two vectors and in are equal if and only if their corresponding components are equal: and . More generally, two vectors and in are equal if and only if for each possible value of .     Operations on Vectors  Vectors are not numbers, but we can now represent them with components that are real numbers. As such, we naturally wonder if it is possible to add two vectors together, multiply two vectors, or combine vectors in any other ways. In this section, we will study two operations on vectors: vector addition and scalar multiplication. To begin, we investigate a natural way to add two vectors together, as well as to multiply a vector by a scalar.   Let , .   Using the two specific vectors above, what is the natural way to define the vector sum ?    In general, how do you think the vector sum of vectors and in should be defined? Write a formal definition of a vector sum based on your intuition.    In general, how do you think the vector sum of vectors and in should be defined? Write a formal definition of a vector sum based on your intuition.    Returning to the specific vector given above, what is the natural way to define the scalar multiple ?    In general, how do you think a scalar multiple of a vector in by a scalar should be defined? how about for a scalar multiple of a vector in by a scalar ? Write a formal definition of a scalar multiple of a vector based on your intuition.      We can now add vectors and multiply vectors by scalars, and thus we can add together scalar multiples of vectors. This allows us to define vector subtraction vector subtraction , , as the sum of and times , so that   Using vector addition and scalar multiplication, we will often represent vectors in terms of the special vectors and . For instance, we can write the vector in as which means that   In the context of , we let , , and , and we can write the vector in as   The vectors , , and are called the standard unit vectors (as we will learn momentarily, unit vectors have length 1), and are important in the physical sciences.    Properties of Vector Operations  We know that the scalar sum is equal to the scalar sum . This is called the commutative property of scalar addition. Any time we define operations on objects (like addition of vectors) we usually want to know what kinds of properties the operations have. For example, is addition of vectors a commutative operation? To answer this question we take two arbitrary vectors and and add them together and see what happens. Let and . Now we use the fact that , , , and are scalars, and that the addition of scalars is commutative to see that   So the vector sum is a commutative operation. Similar arguments can be used to show the following properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication.   Properties of vector operations  Let , , and be vectors in and let and be scalars. Then             The vector has the property that . The vector is called the zero vector .     . The vector is called the additive inverse of the vector .                    .      We verified the first property for vectors in ; it is straightforward to verify that the rest of the eight properties just noted hold for all vectors in .    Geometric Interpretation of Vector Operations  Next, we explore a geometric interpretation of vector addition and scalar multiplication that allows us to visualize these operations. Let and . Then , as shown on the left in Figure .   A vector sum (left), summing displacements (center), the parallelogram law (right).    If we think of these vectors as displacements in the plane, we find a geometric way to envision vector addition. For instance, the vector will represent the displacement obtained by following the displacement with the displacement . We may picture this by placing the tail of at the tip of , as seen in the center of Figure .  Of course, vector addition is commutative so we obtain the same sum if we place the tail of at the tip of . We therefore see that appears as the diagonal of the parallelogram vector sum, parallelogram determined by and , as shown at right in Figure .  Vector subtraction has a similar interpretation. At left in Figure we see vectors , , and . If we rewrite , we have the arrangement shown at right in Figure . In other words, to form the difference , we draw a vector from the tip of to the tip of .   Left: Vector addition. Right: Vector subtraction.       In a similar way, we may geometrically represent a scalar multiple of a vector. For instance, if , then . As shown in Figure , multiplying by 2 leaves the direction unchanged, but stretches by 2. Also, , which shows that multiplying by a negative scalar gives a vector pointing in the opposite direction of .   Scalar multiplication      Left: Sketch sums. Right: Sketch multiples.       Suppose that and are the vectors shown in Figure .   On the axes at left in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    What is ?    On the axes at right in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    Give a geometric description of the set of terminal points of the vectors where is any scalar.    On the set of axes at right in Figure , sketch the vectors , , , , and .    Give a geometric description of the set of terminal points of the vectors where is any scalar.        The Magnitude of a Vector  By definition, vectors have both direction and magnitude (or length). We now investigate how to calculate the magnitude of a vector. Since a vector can be represented by a directed line segment, we can use the distance formula to calculate the length of the segment. This length is the magnitude of the vector and is denoted .    Left: . Right: An arbitrary vector, .         Let and , as shown at left in Figure . Compute .    Let be the vector in with components and as shown at right in Figure .

Two vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude. Notice that position is not considered, so a vector is independent of its location.    If and are two vectors in , then their vector sum is the vector If is a vector in and is a scalar, then the scalar multiple is the vector     The magnitude of the vector in is the scalar A vector is a unit vector provided that .

  "body": " Postscript is a programming language whose primary purpose is to describe the appearance of text or graphics. A simple set of Postscript commands that produces the triangle in the plane with vertices , , and is the following: (0,0) moveto (1,1) lineto stroke (1,-1) lineto stroke (0,0) lineto stroke The key idea in these commands is that we start at the origin, then tell Postscript that we want to start at the point , draw a line from the point to the point (this is what the lineto and stroke commands do), then draw lines from to and back to the origin. Each of these commands encodes two important pieces of information: a direction in which to move and a distance to move. Mathematically, we can capture this information succinctly in a vector. To do so, we record the movement on the map in a pair (this pair is a vector ), where is the horizontal displacement and the vertical displacement from one point to another. So, for example, the vector from the origin to the point is represented by the vector .   What is the vector that describes the displacement from the point to the point ?

In this section, we will introduce a means of multiplying vectors.   For two-dimensional vectors and , the dot product is simply the scalar obtained by    If and , find the dot product .    Find and .    If , find . How is this related to ?    On the axes in Figure , plot the vectors and . Then, find . What is the angle between these vectors?  For part (d)       On the axes in Figure , plot the vector .  For part (e)   For each of the following vectors , plot the vector on Figure and then compute the dot product .    .     .     .     .     .       Based upon the previous part of this activity, what do you think is the sign of the dot product in the following three cases shown in Figure ?  For part (f)           The Dot Product  The definition of the dot product for vectors in given in Preview Activity can be extended to vectors in .   The dot product dot product of vectors and in is the scalar    (As we will see shortly, the dot product arises in physics to calculate the work done by a vector force in a given direction. It might be more natural to define the dot product in this context, but it is more convenient from a mathematical perspective to define the dot product algebraically and then view work as an application of this definition.)  For instance, we find that   Notice that the resulting quantity is a scalar. Our work in Preview Activity examined dot products of two-dimensional vectors.   Determine each of the following.    .           The dot product is a natural way to define a product of two vectors. In addition, it behaves in ways that are similar to the product of, say, real numbers.   Properties of the dot product  Let , , and be vectors in . Then    (the dot product is commutative ), and     .    if is a scalar, then .      Moreover, the dot product gives us valuable geometric information about the vectors and their relative orientation. For instance, let's consider what happens when we dot a vector with itself:   In other words, the dot product of a vector with itself gives the square of the length of the vector: .    The angle between vectors  The dot product can help us understand the angle between two vectors. For instance, if we are given two vectors and , there are two angles that these vectors create, as depicted at left in Figure . We will call , the smaller of these angles, the angle between these vectors vector angle between . Notice that lies between 0 and .  Left: The angle between and . Right: The triangle formed by , , and .        To determine this angle, we may apply the Law of Cosines to the triangle shown at right in Figure .  Using the fact that the dot product of a vector with itself gives us the square of its length, together with the properties of the dot product, we find:   To summarize, we have the important relationship   It is sometimes useful to think of Equation as giving us an expression for the angle between two vectors:   The real beauty of this expression is this: the dot product is a very simple algebraic operation to perform yet it provides us with important geometric information namely the angle between the vectors that would be difficult to determine otherwise.   Determine each of the following.   The length of the vector using the dot product.    The angle between the vectors and to the nearest tenth of a degree.    The angle between the vectors and to the nearest tenth of a degree.    If the angle between the vectors and is a right angle, what does the expression say about their dot product?    If the angle between the vectors and is acute that is, less than what does the expression say about their dot product?    If the angle between the vectors and is obtuse that is, greater than what does the expression say about their dot product?        The Dot Product and Orthogonality  When the angle between two vectors is a right angle, it is frequently the case that something important is happening. In this case, we say the vectors are orthogonal . For instance, orthogonality often plays a role in optimization problems; to determine the shortest path from a point in to a given plane, we move along a line orthogonal to the plane.  As Activity indicates, the dot product provides a simple means to determine whether two vectors are orthogonal to one another. In this case, , so we make the following important observation.   The dot product and orthogonality  Two vectors and in are orthogonal vectors orthogonal to each other if .   More generally, the sign of the dot product gives us useful information about the relative orientation of the vectors. If we remember that we see that for nonzero vectors and , This is illustrated in Figure .   The orientation of vectors      Work, Force, and Displacement  In physics, work is a measure of the energy required to apply a force to an object through a displacement. For instance, Figure shows a force displacing an object from point to point . The displacement is then represented by the vector .   A force displacing an object.    It turns out that the work required to displace the object is   This means that the work is determined only by the magnitude of the force applied parallel to the displacement. Consequently, if we are given two vectors and , we would like to write as a sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to and one of which is orthogonal to . We take up this task after the next activity.   Determine the work done by a 25 pound force acting at a angle to the direction of the object's motion, if the object is pulled 10 feet. In addition, is more work or less work done if the angle to the direction of the object's motion is ?     Projections   Left: . Right: when .       Suppose we are given two vectors and as shown at left in Figure . Motivated by our discussion of work, we would like to write as a sum of two vectors, one of which is parallel to and one of which is orthogonal. That is, we would like to write where is parallel to and is orthogonal to . We call the vector the projection of onto vector projection . Note that, as the diagram at right in Figure illustrates, it is also possible to create a projection even if the angle between the vectors and exceeds .  To find the vector , we will dot both sides of Equation with the vector , to find that   Notice that since is orthogonal to . Also, must be a scalar multiple of since it is parallel to , so we will write . It follows that which means that and hence   It is sometimes useful to write as a scalar times a unit vector in the direction of . We call this scalar the component of along and denote it as . We therefore have so that    The dot product and projections  Let and be vectors in . The component vector component in the direction of of in the direction of is the scalar and the projection vector projection of onto is the vector    Moreover, since it follows that   This shows that once we have computed , we can find simply by calculating the difference of two known vectors.   Let .   Let . Find , and , and draw a picture to illustrate. Finally, express as the sum of two vectors where one is parallel to and the other is perpendicular to .    Now let .

The wind assistance is a measure of the wind speed that is helping push the runners down the track. It is much easier to run a very fast race if the wind is blowing hard in the direction of the race. So that world records aren't dependent on the weather conditions, times are only recorded as record times if the wind aiding the runners is less than or equal to 2 meters per second. Wind speed for a race is recorded by a wind gauge that is set up close to the track. It is important to note, however, that weather is not always as cooperative as we might like. The wind does not always blow exactly in the direction of the track, so the gauge must account for the angle the wind makes with the track. Suppose a 4 mile per hour wind is blowing to aid runners by making a angle with the race track. Determine if any times set during such a race would qualify as records.     Molecular geometry is the geometry determined by arrangements of atoms in molecules. Molecular geometry includes measurements like bond angle, bond length, and torsional angles. These attributes influence several properties of molecules, such as reactivity, color, and polarity.   A methane molecule.     As an example of the molecular geometry of a molecule, consider the methane molecule, as illustrated in Figure . According to the Valence Shell Electron Repulsion (VSEPR) model, atoms that surround single different atoms do so in a way that positions them as far apart as possible. This means that the hydrogen atoms in the methane molecule arrange themselves at the vertices of a regular tetrahedron. The bond angle for methane is the angle determined by two consecutive hydrogen atoms and the central carbon atom. To determine the bond angle for methane, we can place the center carbon atom at the point and the hydrogen atoms at the points , , , and .

To begin, we must emphasize that the cross product is only defined for vectors and in . Also, remember that we use a right-hand coordinate system, as described in Section . In particular, recall that the vectors , , and are oriented as shown below in Figure . Earlier, we noticed that if we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of and our middle finger in the direction of , then our thumb points in the direction of .   Basis vectors , , and .     The cross product of two vectors, and , will itself be a vector denoted . The direction of is determined by the right-hand rule: if we point the index finger of our right hand in the direction of and our middle finger in the direction of , then our thumb points in the direction of .   We begin by defining the cross products using the vectors , , and . Referring to Figure , explain why , , in that order form a right-hand system. We then define to be  that is .    Now explain why , , and in that order form a right-hand system. We then define to be  that is .    Continuing in this way, complete the missing entries in Table .  Table of cross products involving , , and .                                     Up to this point, the products you have seen, such as the product of real numbers and the dot product of vectors, have been commutative, meaning that the product does not depend on the order of the terms. For instance, . The table above suggests, however, that the cross product is anti-commutative : for any vectors and in , . If we consider the case when , this shows that . What does this tell us about ; in particular, what vector is unchanged by scalar multiplication by ?    It is not difficult to show that the cross product interacts with scalar multiplication and vector addition as one would expect: that is We can combine these properties to make cross product calculations a bit easier. For example, Using these properties along with Table , find the cross product if and .    Verify that the cross product you just found in part (e) is orthogonal to both and .    Consider the vectors and in the -plane as shown below in Figure .  Two vectors in the -plane     Explain why and . Then compute the length of .        Computing the cross product  As we have seen in Preview Activity , the cross product is defined for two vectors and in and produces another vector in . Using the right-hand rule, we saw that                            If, in addition, we assume the cross product behaves like we think a product should (e.g., the cross product distributes over vector addition), we can compute the cross product in terms of the components of general vectors to find a formula for the cross product. Doing so we see that (Like the dot product, the cross product arises in physical applications, e.g., torque, but it is more convenient mathematically to begin from an algebraic perspective.)  The previous calculations lead us to define the cross product of vectors in as follows.   The cross product cross product  of vectors and in is the vector      At first, this may look intimidating and difficult to remember. However, if we rewrite the expression in Equation using determinants, important structure emerges. The determinant of a matrix is   It follows that we can thus rewrite Equation in the form   For those familiar with the determinant of a matrix, we write the mnemonic as    Suppose and . Use the formula for the following.   Find the cross product .    Evaluate the dot products and . What does this tell you about the geometric relationship among , , and ?    Find the cross product .    Multiplication of real numbers is associative , which means, for instance, that . Is it true that the cross product of vectors is associative? For instance, is it true that ?    Find the cross product .      The cross product satisfies the following properties, some of which were illustrated in Preview Activity and may be easily verified from the definition .   Properties of the cross product  Let , , and be vectors in , and let be a scalar. Then                   if and are parallel.    The cross product is not associative; that is, in general       Just as we found for the dot product, the cross product provides us with useful geometric information. In particular, both the length and direction of the cross product encode information about the geometric relationship between and .    The Length of  We may ask whether the length has any relationship to the lengths of and . To investigate, we will compute the square of the length and denote by the angle between and , as in Section . Doing so, we find through some significant algebra that   Therefore, we have found , which means that   Note that the third property stated above says that if and are parallel. This is reflected in Equation since if and are parallel, which implies that .  Equation also has a geometric implication. Consider the parallelogram formed by two vectors and , as shown in Figure .   The parallelogram formed by and    Remember that the area of a parallelogram is the product of its base and height. As shown in the figure, we may consider the base of the parallelogram to be and the height to be . This means that the area of the parallelogram formed by and is   This leads to the following interesting fact.   The length of the cross product  The length, , of the cross product of vectors and is the area of the parallelogram determined by and .   Note also that if and are vectors in the -plane, then Equation shows that the area of the parallelogram determined by and is is the absolute value of the determinant So the absolute value of a determinant of a matrix is also the area of a parallelogram.     Find the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors and .    Find the area of the parallelogram in whose vertices are , , , and . (Hint: It might be helpful to draw a picture to see how the vertices are arranged so you can determine which vectors you might use.)       The Direction of  Now that we understand the length of , we will investigate its direction. Remember from Preview Activity that cross products involving the vectors , , and resulted in vectors that are orthogonal to the two terms. We will see that this holds more generally.  We begin by computing , and see that   To summarize, we have , which implies that is orthogonal to . In the same way, we can show that is orthogonal to . The net effect is that is a vector that is perpendicular to both and , and hence is perpendicular to the plane determined by and . Moreover, the direction of is determined by applying the right-hand rule to and , as we saw in Preview Activity . In light of our earlier work that showed , we may now express in the following different way.   The cross product as normal vector  Suppose that and are not parallel and that is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing and determined by the right-hand rule. Then    There is yet one more geometric implication we may draw from this result. Suppose , , and are vectors in that are not coplanar and that form a three-dimension parallelepiped as shown in Figure .   The parallelepiped determined by , , and    The volume of the parallelepiped is determined by multiplying , the area of the base, by the height . As we have just seen, the area of the base is . Moreover, the height where is the angle between and the vector , which is orthogonal to the plane formed by and . Since is parallel to , the angle between and is also . This shows that and therefore   The cross product and the volume of a parallelepiped  The volume of the parallelepiped determined by , , and is .   As a dot product of two vectors, the quantity is a scalar and is called the triple scalar product triple scalar product .   Suppose and .   Find two unit vectors orthogonal to both and .    Find the volume of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors , , and .    Find a vector orthogonal to the plane containing the points , , and .    Given the vectors and shown below in Figure , sketch the cross products and .  Vectors and       Do the vectors , , and in standard position lie in the same plane? Use the concepts from this section to explain.        Torque is measured by a cross product  We have seen that the cross product enables us to produce a vector perpendicular to two given vectors, to measure the area of a parallelogram, and to measure the volume of a parallelepiped. Besides these geometric applications, the cross product also enables us to describe a physical quantity called torque .  Suppose that we would like to turn a bolt using a wrench as shown in Figure . If a force is applied to the wrench and is the vector from the position on the wrench at which the force is applied to center of the bolt, we define the torque, , to be    A force applied to a wrench    When a force is applied to an object, Newton's Second Law tells us that the force is equal to the rate of change of the object's linear momentum. Similarly, the torque applied to an object is equal to the rate of change of the object's angular momentum. In other words, torque will cause the bolt to rotate.  In many industrial applications, bolts are required to be tightened using a specified torque. Of course, the magnitude of the torque is . Thus, to produce a larger torque, we can increase either or , which you may know if you have ever removed lug nuts when changing a flat tire. The ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes said: Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world. A modern spin on this statement is: Allow me to make large enough, and I shall produce a torque large enough to move the world.     Comparing the dot and cross products  Finally, it is worthwhile to compare and contrast the dot and cross products.   (a)   is a scalar, while is a vector.    (b)   , while     (c)   , while .    (d)   if and are perpendicular, while if and are parallel.       Summary    The cross product is defined only for vectors in . The cross product of vectors and in is the vector     Geometrically, the cross product is where is the angle between and and is a unit vector perpendicular to both and as determined by the right-hand rule.

  "body": " Lines and Planes in Space     How are lines in similar to and different from lines in ?    What is the role that vectors play in representing equations of lines, particularly in ?    How can we think of a plane as a set of points determined by a point and a vector?    How do we find the equation of a plane through three given non-collinear points?      In single variable calculus, we learn that a differentiable function is locally linear . locally linear In other words, if we zoom in on the graph of a differentiable function at a point, the graph looks like the tangent line to the function at that point. Linear functions played important roles in single variable calculus, useful in approximating differentiable functions, in approximating roots of functions (see Newton's Method), and approximating solutions to first order differential equations (see Euler's Method). In multivariable calculus, we will soon study curves in space; differentiable curves turn out to be locally linear as well. In addition, as we study functions of two variables, we will see that such a function is locally linear at a point if the surface defined by the function looks like a plane (the tangent plane) as we zoom in on the graph.  Consequently, it is important for us to understand both lines and planes in space, as these define the linear functions in and . (Recall that a function is linear if it is a polynomial function whose terms all have degree less than or equal to 1. For example, defines a single variable linear function and a two variable linear function, but is not linear since it has degree two, the sum of the degress of its factors.) We begin our work by considering some familiar ideas in but from a new perspective.   We are familiar with equations of lines in the plane in the form , where is the slope of the line and is the -intercept. In this activity, we explore a more flexible way of representing lines that we can use not only in the plane, but in higher dimensions as well.  To begin, consider the line through the point with slope as shown in Figure .   The line through with slope .      Suppose we increase by 1 from the point . How does the -value change? What is the point on the line with -coordinate ?    Suppose we decrease by 3.25 from the point . How does the -value change? What is the point on the line with -coordinate ?    Now, suppose we increase by some arbitrary value from the point . How does the -value change? What is the point on the line with -coordinate ?    Observe that the slope of the line is related to any vector whose -component divided by the -component is the slope of the line. For the line in this exercise, we might use the vector , which describes the direction of the line. Explain why the terminal points of the vectors , where trace out the graph of the line through the point with slope .    Now we extend this vector approach to and consider a second example. Let be the line in through the point in the direction of the vector . Find the coordinates of three distinct points on line . Explain your thinking.    Find a vector in the form whose terminal points trace out the line that is described in (e). That is, you should be able to locate any point on the line by determining a corresponding value of .       Lines in Space  In two-dimensional space, a non-vertical line is defined to be the set of points satisfying the equation for some constants and . The value of (the slope) tells us how the dependent variable changes for every one unit increase in the independent variable, while the point is the -intercept and anchors the line to a location on the -axis. Alternatively, we can think of the slope as being related to the vector , which tells us the direction of the line, as shown on the left in Figure . Thus, we can identify a line in space by fixing a point and a direction , as shown on the right. Since we also have vectors in space to provide direction, this same idea of a point and a direction determining a line works in for any .   A vector description of a line      A line line in space in space is the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector .    The fixed vector in the definition is called a direction vector line direction vector for the line. As we saw in Preview Activity , to find an equation for a line through point in the direction of vector , observe that any vector parallel to will have the form for some scalar . So, any vector emanating from the point in a direction parallel to the vector will be of the form for some scalar (where is the origin).   A line in 2-space.         Figure presents three images of a line in two-space in which we can identify the vector and the vector as in Equation . Here, is the fixed vector shown in blue, while the direction vector is the vector parallel to the vector shown in green (that is, the green vector represents , and the line is traced out by the terminal points of the magenta vector). In other words, the tips (terminal points) of the magenta vectors (the vectors of the form ) trace out the line as changes.  In particular, the terminal points of the vectors of the form in define a linear function in space of the following form, which is valid in any dimension.   The vector form of a line  The vector form of a line line vector equation through the point in the direction of the vector is where is the position vector from the origin to the point .   Of course, it is common to represent lines in the plane using the slope-intercept equation . The vector form of the line, described above, is an alternative way to represent lines that has the following two advantages. First, in two dimensions, we are able to represent vertical lines, whose slope is not defined, using a vertical direction vector, such as . Second, this description of lines works in any dimension even though there is no concept of the slope of a line in more than two dimensions.   A line in 3-space.         Let and . Let be the line in through and , and note that three snapshots of this line are shown in Figure .   Find a direction vector for the line .    Find a vector equation of in the form .    Consider the vector equation What is the direction of the line given by ? Is this new line parallel to line ?    Do and represent the same line, ? Explain.        The Parametric Equations of a Line  The vector form of a line, in Equation , describes a line as the set of terminal points of the vectors . If we write this in terms of components letting then we can equate the components on both sides of to obtain the equations which describe the coordinates of the points on the line. The variable represents an arbitrary scalar and is called a parameter . In particular, we use the following language.   The parametric equations of a line  The parametric equations for a line line parametric equations through the point in the direction of the vector are    Notice that there are many different parametric equations for the same line. For example, choosing another point on the line or another direction vector produces another set of parametric equations. It is sometimes useful to think of as a time parameter and the parametric equations as telling us where we are on the line at each time. In this way, the parametric equations describe a particular walk taken along the line; there are, of course, many possible ways to walk along a line.   Let and , and let be the line in through and , which is the same line as in Activity .   Find parametric equations of the line .    Does the point lie on ? If so, what value of results in this point?    Consider another line, , whose parametric equations are What is the direction of the line ?    Do the lines and intersect? If so, provide the point of intersection and the and values, respectively, that result in the point. If not, explain why.        Planes in Space  Now that we have a way of describing lines, we would like to develop a means of describing planes in three dimensions. We studied the coordinate planes and planes parallel to them in Section . Each of those planes had one of the variables , , or equal to a constant. We can note that any vector in a plane with constant is orthogonal to the vector , any vector in a plane with constant is orthogonal to the vector , and any vector in a plane with constant is orthogonal to the vector . This idea works in general to define a plane.    A plane plane definition  in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector , as shown in Figure .     A point on a plane with a normal vector    The definition allows us to find the equation of a plane. Assume that , , and that is an arbitrary point on the plane. Since the vector lies in the plane, it must be perpendicular to . This means that   The fixed vector perpendicular to the plane is frequently called a normal vector to the plane. We may now summarize as follows.   Equations of a plane     The scalar equation of the plane plane scalar equation with normal vector containing the point is     The vector equation of the plane plane vector equation with normal vector containing the points and is       We may take the scalar equation of a plane a little further and note that since it equivalently follows that   That is, we may write an equation of a plane as where .  For instance, if we would like to describe the plane passing through the point and perpendicular to the vector , we have or   Notice that the coefficients of , , and in this description give a vector perpendicular to the plane. For instance, if we are presented with the plane we know that is a vector perpendicular to the plane.     Write a scalar equation of the plane passing through the point and perpendicular to the vector .    Is the point on the plane ?    Write a scalar equation of the plane that is parallel to and passing through the point . (Hint: Compare normal vectors of the planes.)    Write a parametric description of the line passing through the point and perpendicular to the plane described by the equation .    Find the point at which intersects the plane .     Just as two distinct points in space determine a line, three non-collinear points in space determine a plane. Consider three points , , and in space, not all lying on the same line as shown in Figure .   A plane determined by three points , , and    Observe that the vectors and both lie in the plane . If we form their cross-product we obtain a normal vector to the plane . Therefore, if is any other point on , it then follows that will be perpendicular to , and we have, as before, the equation    Let , , and and let be the plane containing , , and .   Determine the components of the vectors and .    Find a normal vector to the plane .    Find a scalar equation of the plane .    Consider a second plane, , with scalar equation . Find two different points on plane , as well as a vector that is normal to .    The angle between two planes is the acute angle between their respective normal vectors. What is the angle between planes and ?        Summary    While lines in do not have a slope, like lines in they can be characterized by a point and a direction vector. Indeed, we define a line in space to be the set of terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point that are parallel to a fixed vector.    Vectors play a critical role in representing the equation of a line. In particular, the terminal points of the vector define a linear function in space through the terminal point of the vector in the direction of the vector , tracing out a line in space.    A plane in space is the set of all terminal points of vectors emanating from a given point perpendicular to a fixed vector.    If , , and are non-collinear points in space, the vectors and and are vectors in the plane and the vector is a normal vector to the plane. So any point in the plane satisfies the equation . If we let , be the normal vector, and , we can also represent the plane with the equation         Rewrite the vector equation as the corresponding parametric equations for the line.                              Find the vector and parametric equations for the line through the point P(4, 2, 4) and parallel to the vector .  Vector Form: , , 4  , , -3  Parametric form (parameter t, and passing through P when t = 0):                                               Consider the line which passes through the point P(5, -2, -2), and which is parallel to the line  Find the point of intersection of this new line with each of the coordinate planes:  xy-plane: ( , , )  xz-plane: ( , , )  yz-plane: ( , , )                                                      Find the point at which the line intersects the plane .  ( , , )                        Find an equation of a plane containing the three points (-3, 2, -4), (-1, -2, -1), (-1, -1, 1) in which the coefficient of is -11.  = 0.               Find an equation for the plane containing the line in the -plane where , and the line in the -plane where .  equation:        Both lines are parallel to the -axis; thus our plane must have -slope zero. On the other hand, the line in the -plane is 3 units down and unit in front of of the line in the -plane; hence the -slope of our plane must be . Thus the equation is for some constant . Since the plane contains the point , the value of must be 3. So the equation is This is shown in the graph below.         Find the angle in radians between the planes and              A store sells CDs at one price and DVDs at another price. The figure below shows the revenue (in dollars) of the music store as a function of the number, , of CDs and the number, , of DVDs that it sells. The values of the revenue are shown on each line.   (Hint: for this problem there are many possible ways to estimate the requisite values; you should be able to find information from the figure that allows you to give an answer that is essentially exact.)  (a) What is the price of a CD? dollars  (b) What is the price of a DVD? dollars             , is linear and so we may write it as: where is the price of CDs and is the price of DVDs, in dollars. From the diagram, we can pick two points, such as , on the contour , and , on the contour . These points give the following system of linear equations: Solving gives dollars and dollars.        The table below gives the number of calories burned per minute for someone roller-blading, as a function of the person's weight in pounds and speed in miles per hour [from the August 28,1994, issue of Parade Magazine ].  calories burned per minute    weight speed  8  9  10  11    120  4.2  5.8  7.4  8.9    140  5.1  6.7  8.3  9.9    160  6.1  7.7  9.2  10.8    180  7  8.6  10.2  11.7    200  7.9  9.5  11.1  12.6    (a) Suppose that a 140 lb person and a 200 person both go 10 miles, the first at 10 mph and the second at 9 mph.  How many calories does the 140 lb person burn?  How many calories does the 200 lb person burn?  (b) We might also be interested in the number of calories each person burns per pound of their weight.  How many calories per pound does the 140 lb person burn?  How many calories per pound does the 200 lb person burn?                       (a) The time in minutes to go 10 miles at a speed of mph is . Thus the 140 lb person going 10 mph uses calories, and the 200 lb person going 9 mph uses calories. (b) The 140 lb person burns calories per pound for the trip, while the 200 lb person burns calories per pound for the trip.        The vector and parametric forms of a line allow us to easily describe line segments in space.  Let and , and let be the line in through and as in Activity .   What value of the parameter makes ? What value of makes ?    What values describe the line segment between the points and ?    What about the line segment (along the same line) from to ?    Now, consider a segment that lies on a different line: parameterize the segment that connects point to in such a way that corresponds to point , while corresponds to .       This exercise explores key relationships between a pair of lines. Consider the following two lines: one with parametric equations , , , and the other being the line through in the direction .   Find a direction vector for the first line, which is given in parametric form.    Find parametric equations for the second line, written in terms of the parameter .    Show that the two lines intersect at a single point by finding the values of and that result in the same point. Then find the point of intersection.    Find the acute angle formed where the two lines intersect, noting that this angle will be given by the acute angle between their respective direction vectors.    Find an equation for the plane that contains both of the lines described in this problem.       This exercise explores key relationships between a pair of planes. Consider the following two planes: one with scalar equation , and the other which passes through the points , , and .   Find a vector normal to the first plane.    Find a scalar equation for the second plane.    Find the angle between the planes, where the angle between them is defined by the angle between their respective normal vectors.    Find a point that lies on both planes.    Since these two planes do not have parallel normal vectors, the planes must intersect, and thus must intersect in a line. Observe that the line of intersection lies in both planes, and thus the direction vector of the line must be perpendicular to each of the respective normal vectors of the two planes. Find a direction vector for the line of intersection for the two planes.    Determine parametric equations for the line of intersection of the two planes.       In this problem, we explore how we can use what we know about vectors and projections to find the distance from a point to a plane.  Let be the plane with equation , and let .   Show that does not lie in the plane .    Find a normal vector to the plane .    Find the coordinates of a point in .    Find the components of . Draw a picture to illustrate the objects found so far.    Explain why gives the distance from the point to the plane . Find this distance.       "

  "body": " Vector-Valued Functions     What is a vector-valued function? What do we mean by the graph of a vector-valued function?    What is a parameterization of a curve in ? In ? What can the parameterization of a curve tell us?      So far, we have seen several different examples of curves in space, including traces and contours of functions of two variables, as well as lines in 3-space. Recall that for a line through a fixed point in the direction of vector , we may express the line parametrically through the single vector equation   From this perspective, the vector is a function that depends on the parameter , and the terminal points of this vector trace out the line in space.  Like lines, other curves in space are one-dimensional objects, and thus we aspire to similarly express the coordinates of points on a given curve in terms of a single variable. Vectors are a perfect vehicle for doing so we can use vectors based at the origin to identify points in space, and connect the terminal points of these vectors to draw a curve in space. This approach will allow us to draw an incredible variety of graphs in 2- and 3-space, as well as to identify and describe curves in -space for any . It will also allow us to represent traces and cross sections of surfaces in space.   In this activity we consider how we might use vectors to define a curve in space.   On a single set of axes in , draw the vectors    ,     ,     , and        with their initial points at the origin.    On the same set of axes, draw the vectors    ,     ,     , and        with their initial points at the origin.    Based on the pictures from parts (a) and (b), sketch the set of terminal points of all of the vectors of the form , where assumes values from 0 to . What is the resulting figure? Why?    Suppose we sketched the terminal points of all vectors of the form , where assumes values from 0 to . How does the resulting picture differ from the one in part (c)? What about for from 0 to ?        Vector-Valued Functions  Consider the curve shown in Figure . As in Preview Activity , we can think of a point on this curve as resulting from a vector from the origin to the point. As the point travels along the curve, the vector changes in order to terminate at the desired point. A few still pictures of this motion are shown in Figure .   The graph of a curve in space.        Thus, we can think of the curve as a collection of terminal points of vectors emanating from the origin. We therefore view a point traveling along this curve as a function of time , and define a function whose input is the variable and whose output is the vector from the origin to the point on the curve at time . In so doing, we have introduced a new type of function, one whose input is a scalar and whose output is a vector.  The terminal points of the vector outputs of then trace out the curve in space. From this perspective, the , , and coordinates of the point are functions of time, , say and thus we have three coordinate functions that enable us to represent the curve. The variable is called a parameter and the equations , , and are called parametric equations (or a parameterization of the curve ). The function whose output is the vector from the origin to a point on the curve is defined by   Note that the input of is the real-valued parameter and the corresponding output is vector . Such a function is called a vector-valued function because each real number input generates a vector output. More formally, we state the following definition.    A vector-valued function vector-valued function definition is a function whose input is a real parameter and whose output is a vector that depends on . The graph graph of a vector-valued function definition of a vector-valued function is the set of all terminal points of the output vectors with their initial points at the origin.   Parametric equations parametric equations for a curve parameterization curve for a curve are equations of the form that describe the coordinates of a point on a curve in .    Note particularly that every set of parametric equations determines a vector-valued function of the form and every vector-valued function defines a set of parametric equations for a curve. Moreover, we can consider vector-valued functions and parameterizations in , , or indeed a real space of any dimension. As a reminder, in Section , we determined the parametric equations of a line in space using a point and a direction vector. For a nonlinear example, the curve in Figure has the parametric equations   Represented as a vector-valued function , the curve in Figure is the graph of    The same curve can be represented with different parameterizations. Use appropriate technology to plot the curves generated by the following vector-valued functions for values of from to . Compare and contrast the graphs explain how they are alike and how they are different.                         The examples in Activity illustrate that a parameterization allows us to look not only at the graph, but at the direction and speed at which the graph is traversed as changes. In the different parameterizations of the circle, we see that we can start at different points and move around the circle in either direction. The calculus of vector-valued functions which we will begin to investigate in Section  will enable us to precisely quantify the direction, speed, and acceleration of a particle moving along a curve in space. As such, describing curves parametrically will allow us to not only indicate the curve itself, but also to describe how motion occurs along the curve.  Using parametric equations to define vector-valued functions in two dimensions is much more versatile than just defining as a function of . In fact, if is a function of , then we can parameterize the graph of by and thus every single-variable function may be described parametrically. In addition, as we saw in Preview Activity and Activity , we can use vector-valued functions to represent curves in the plane that do not define as a function of (or as a function of ). (As a side note: vector-valued functions make it easy to plot the inverse of a one-to-one function in two dimensions. To see how, if defines a one-to-one function, then we can parameterize this function by . Since the inverse function just reverses the role of input and output, a parameterization for is .)   Vector-valued functions can be used to generate many interesting curves. Graph each of the following using an appropriate technological tool, and then write one sentence for each function to describe the behavior of the resulting curve.                   (Note that this defines a curve in 3-space.)    Experiment with different formulas for and and ranges for to see what other interesting curves you can generate. Share your best results with peers.      Recall from our earlier work that the traces and level curves of a function are themselves curves in space. Thus, we may determine parameterizations for them. For example, if , the trace of the function is given by setting and letting be parameterized by the variable ; then, the trace is the curve whose parameterization is    Consider the paraboloid defined by .

Summary    A vector-valued function is a function whose input is a real parameter and whose output is a vector that depends on .

  "body": " Derivatives and Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions     What do we mean by the derivative of a vector-valued function and how do we calculate it?    What does the derivative of a vector-valued function measure?    What do we mean by the integral of a vector-valued function and how do we compute it?    How do we describe the motion of a projectile if the only force acting on the object is acceleration due to gravity?      A vector-valued function determines a curve in space as the collection of terminal points of the vectors . If the curve is smooth, it is natural to ask whether has a derivative. In the same way, our experiences with integrals in single-variable calculus prompt us to wonder what the integral of a vector-valued function might be and what it might tell us. We explore both of these questions in detail in this section.  For now, let's recall some important ideas from calculus I. Given a function that measures the position of an object moving along an axis, its derivative, , is defined by and measures the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to time. In particular, for a fixed value , measures the velocity of the moving object, as well as the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point .  As we work with vector-valued functions, we will strive to update these ideas and perspectives into the context of curves in space and outputs that are vectors.   Let describe the path traveled by an object at time .   Use appropriate technology to help you sketch the graph of the vector-valued function , and then locate and label the point on the graph when .    Recall that for functions of a single variable, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives; that is, . With this idea in mind and viewing and as constant vectors, what do you expect the derivative of to be? Write a proposed formula for .    Use your result from part (b) to compute . Sketch this vector as emanating from the point on the graph of when , and explain what you think tells us about the object's motion.        The Derivative  In single variable calculus, we define the derivative, , of a given function by provided the limit exists. At a given value of , measures the instantaneous rate of change of , and also tells us the slope of the tangent line to the curve at the point . The definition of the derivative extends naturally to vector-valued functions and curves in space.    The derivative vector-valued function derivative of a vector-valued function is defined to be for those values of at which the limit exists. We also use the notation and for .     Let's investigate how we can interpret the derivative . Let be the vector-valued function whose graph is shown in Figure , and let be a scalar that represents a small change in time. The vector is the blue vector in Figure and is the green vector.   A single difference quotient.      Is the quantity a vector or a scalar? Identify this object in Figure .    Is a vector or a scalar? Sketch a representative vector with in Figure .    Think of as providing the position of an object moving along the curve these vectors trace out. What do you think that the vector measures? Why? (Hint: You might think analogously about difference quotients such as or from calculus I.)     Figure presents three snapshots of the vectors as we let . Write 2-3 sentences to describe key attributes of the vector (Hint: Compare to limits such as or from calculus I, keeping in mind that in three dimensions there is no general concept of slope.)     Snapshots of several difference quotients.         As Activity indicates, if determines the position of an object at time , then represents the average rate of change in the position of the object over the interval , which is also the average velocity of the object on this interval. Thus, the derivative is the instantaneous rate of change of at time (for those values of for which the limit exists), so is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time . Furthermore, we can interpret the derivative as the direction vector of the line tangent to the graph of at the value .  Similarly, is the instantaneous rate of change of the velocity of the object at time , for those values of for which the limits exists, and thus is the acceleration of the moving object.   Note well: Both the velocity and acceleration are vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction. By contrast, the magnitude of the velocity vector, , which is the speed of the object at time , is a scalar quantity.    Computing Derivatives  As we learned in single variable calculus, computing derivatives from the definition is often difficult. Fortunately, properties of the limit make it straightforward to calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function similar to how we developed shortcut differentiation rules in calculus I. To see why, recall that the limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, and that we can remove constant factors from limits. Thus, as we observed in a particular example in Preview Activity , if , it follows that   Thus, we can calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function by simply differentiating its components.   The derivative of a vector-valued function  If , then for those values of at which , , and are differentiable.    For each of the following vector-valued functions, find .    .     .     .     .      In first-semester calculus, we developed several important differentiation rules, including the constant multiple, product, quotient, and chain rules. For instance, recall that we formally state the product rule as   There are several analogous rules for vector-valued functions, including a product rule for scalar functions and vector-valued functions. These rules, which are easily verified, are summarized as follows.   Properties of derivatives of vector-valued functions  Let be a differentiable real-valued function of a real variable and let and be differentiable vector-valued functions of the real variable . Then                        .       Note well. When applying these properties, use care to interpret the quantities involved as either scalars or vectors. For example, defines a scalar function because we have taken the dot product of two vector-valued functions. However, defines a vector-valued function since we have taken the cross product of two vector-valued functions.   The left side of Figure shows the curve described by the vector-valued function defined by    The curve and its speed.         Find the object's velocity .    Find the object's acceleration .    Indicate on the left of Figure the object's position, velocity and acceleration at the times . Draw the velocity and acceleration vectors with their tails placed at the object's position.    Recall that the speed is . Find the object's speed and graph it as a function of time on the right of Figure . When is the object's speed the slowest? When is the speed increasing? When is it decreasing?    What seems to be true about the angle between and when the speed is at a minimum? What is the angle between and when the speed is increasing? when the speed is decreasing?    Since the square root is an increasing function, we see that the speed increases precisely when is increasing. Use the product rule for the dot product to express in terms of the velocity and acceleration . Use this to explain why the speed is increasing when and decreasing when . Compare this to part (d).    Show that the speed's rate of change is        Tangent Lines  One of the most important ideas in first-semester calculus is that a differentiable function is locally linear : that is, when viewed up close, the curve generated by a differentiable function looks very much like a line. Indeed, when we zoom in sufficiently far on a particular point, the curve looks indistinguishable from its tangent line.  In the same way, we expect that a smooth curve in 3-space will be locally linear. In the following activity, we investigate how to find the tangent line to such a curve. Recall from our work in Section that the vector equation of a line that passes through the point at the tip of the vector in the direction of the vector can be written as   In parametric form, the line is given by    Let Sketch the curve using some appropriate tool.   Determine the coordinates of the point on the curve traced out by when .    Find a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of at the point where .    Find the parametric equations of the line tangent to the graph of when .    Sketch a plot of the curve and its tangent line near the point where . In addition, include a sketch of . What is the important role of in this activity?      We see that our work in Activity can be generalized. Given a differentiable vector-valued function , the tangent line to the curve at the input value is given by   Here we see that because the tangent line is determined entirely by a given point and direction, the point is provided by the function , evaluated at , while the direction is provided by the derivative, , again evaluated at . Note how analogous the formula for is to the tangent line approximation from single-variable calculus: in that context, for a given function at a value , we found that the tangent line can be expressed by the linear function whose formula is   Equation for the tangent line to the vector-valued function is nearly identical. Indeed, because there are multiple parameterizations for a single line, it is even possible to write the parameterization as (For example, in Equation , , so the line's parameterization starts at . When we write the parameterization in the form of Equation , , so the line's parameterization starts at .)  As we will learn more in Chapter 10, a smooth surface in 3-space is also locally linear. That means that the surface will look like a plane, which we call its tangent plane , as we zoom in on the graph. It is possible to use tangent lines to traces of the surface to generate a formula for the tangent plane; see Exercise at the end of this section for more details.    Integrating a Vector-Valued Function  Recall from single variable calculus that an antiderivative of a function of the independent variable is a function that satisfies . We then defined the indefinite integral to be the general antiderivative of . Recall that the general antiderivative includes an added constant in order to indicate that the general antiderivative is in fact an entire family of functions. We can do the similar work with vector-valued functions.    An antiderivative vector-valued function antiderivative of a vector-valued function is a vector-valued function such that   The indefinite integral vector-valued function indefinite integral  of a vector-valued function is the general antiderivative of and represents the collection of all antiderivatives of .    The same reasoning that allows us to differentiate a vector-valued function componentwise applies to integrating as well. Recall that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals and also that we can remove constant factors from integrals. So, given , it follows that we can integrate componentwise. Expressed more formally,   Integrating a vector-valued function  If , then    In light of being able to integrate and differentiate componentwise with vector-valued functions, we can solve many problems that are analogous to those we encountered in single-variable calculus. For instance, recall problems where we were given an object moving along an axis with velocity function and an initial position . In that context, we were able to differentiate in order to find acceleration, and integrate and use the initial condition in order to find the position function . In the following activity, we explore similar ideas with vector-valued functions.   Suppose a moving object in space has its velocity given by   A graph of the position of the object for times in is shown in Figure . Suppose further that the object is at the point at time .   Determine , the acceleration of the object at time .    Determine , position of the object at time .    Compute and sketch the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of the object at time , using Figure .    Finally, determine the vector equation for the tangent line, , that is tangent to the position curve at .      The position graph for the function in Activity .       Projectile Motion  Any time that an object is launched into the air with a given velocity and launch angle, the path the object travels is determined almost exclusively by the force of gravity. Whether in sports such as archery or shotput, in military applications with artillery, or in important fields like firefighting, it is important to be able to know when and where a launched projectile will land. We can use our knowledge of vector-valued functions in order to completely determine the path traveled by an object that is launched from a given position at a given angle from the horizontal with a given initial velocity.   Projectile motion.    Assume we fire a projectile from a launcher and the only force acting on the fired object is the force of gravity pulling down on the object. That is, we assume no effect due to spin, wind, or air resistance. With these assumptions, the motion of the object will be planar, so we can also assume that the motion occurs in two-dimensional space. Suppose we launch the object from an initial position at an angle with the positive -axis as illustrated in Figure , and that we fire the object with an initial speed of , where is the velocity vector of the object at time . Assume is the positive constant acceleration force due to gravity, which acts to pull the fired object toward the ground (in the negative direction). Note particularly that there is no external force acting on the object to move it in the direction.  We first observe that since gravity only acts in the downward direction and that the acceleration due to gravity is constant, the acceleration vector is . That is, . We may use this fact about acceleration, together with the initial position and initial velocity in order to fully determine the position of the object at time . In Exercise , you can work through the details to show that the following general formula holds.   The motion of a projectile  If an object is launched from a point with initial velocity at an angle with the horizontal, then the position of the object at time is given by    This assumes that the only force acting on the object is the acceleration due to gravity. projectile motion parametric equations     Summary    If is a vector-valued function, then the derivative of is defined by for those values of at which the limit exists, and is computed componentwise by the formula for those values of at which , , and are differentiable, where .    The derivative of the vector-valued function tells us the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to time, , which can be interpreted as a direction vector for the line tangent to the graph of at the point , or also as the instantaneous velocity of an object traveling along the graph defined by at time .    An antiderivative of is a vector-valued function such that . The indefinite integral of a vector-valued function is the general antiderivative of (which is a collection of all of the antiderivatives of , with any two antiderivatives differing by at most a constant vector). Moreover, if , then     If an object is launched from a point with initial velocity at an angle with the horizontal, then the position of the object at time is given by provided that that the only force acting on the object is the acceleration due to gravity.

  "body": " Arc Length and Curvature     How can a definite integral be used to measure the length of a curve in 2- or 3-space?    Why is arc length useful as a parameter?    What is the curvature of a curve?      Given a space curve, there are two natural geometric questions one might ask: how long is the curve and how much does it bend? In this section, we answer both questions by developing techniques for measuring the length of a space curve as well as its curvature.   In earlier investigations, we have used integration to calculate quantities such as area, volume, mass, and work. We are now interested in determining the length of a space curve.  Consider the smooth curve in 3-space defined by the vector-valued function , where for in the interval . Pictures of the graph of are shown in Figure . We will use the integration process to calculate the length of this curve. In this situation we partition the interval into subintervals of equal length and let be the endpoints of the subintervals. We then approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with some related quantity that we can compute. In this case, we approximate the length of the curve on each subinterval with the length of the segment connecting the endpoints. Figure illustrates the process in three different instances using increasing values of .   Approximating the length of the curve with , , and .          Write a formula for the length of the line segment that connects the endpoints of the curve on the th subinterval . (This length is our approximation of the length of the curve on this interval.)    Use your formula in part (a) to write a sum that adds all of the approximations to the lengths on each subinterval.    What do we need to do with the sum in part (b) in order to obtain the exact value of the length of the graph of on the interval ?       Arc Length  Consider a smooth curve in 3-space that is parametrically described by the vector-valued function defined by  Preview Activity shows that to approximate the length of the curve defined by as the values of run over an interval , we partition the interval into subintervals of equal length , with as the endpoints of the subintervals. On each subinterval, we approximate the length of the curve by the length of the line segment connecting the endpoints. The points on the curve corresponding to and are and , respectively, so the length of the line segment connecting these points is   Now we add all of these approximations together to obtain an approximation to the length of the curve:   We now want to take the limit of this sum as goes to infinity, but in its present form it might be difficult to see how. We first introduce by multiplying by , and see that   To get the difference quotients under the radical, we use properties of the square root function to see further that   Recall that as we also have . Since we see that is equal to   Noting further that we can rewrite our arclength formula in a more succinct form as follows.   The length of a curve  If defines a smooth curve on an interval , then the length arclength  of is given by    Note that formula applies to curves in any dimensional space. Moreover, this formula has a natural interpretation: if records the position of a moving object, then is the object's velocity and its speed. Formula says that we simply integrate the speed of an object traveling over the curve to find the distance traveled by the object, which is the same as the length of the curve, just as in one-variable calculus.   Here we calculate the arc length of two familiar curves.   Use Equation to calculate the circumference of a circle of radius .    Find the exact length of the spiral defined by on the interval .      We can adapt the arc length formula to curves in 2-space that define as a function of as the following activity shows.   Let define a smooth curve in 2-space. Parameterize this curve and use Equation to show that the length of the curve defined by on an interval is      Parameterizing With Respect To Arc Length  In addition to helping us to find the length of space curves, the expression for the length of a curve enables us to find a natural parametrization of space curves in terms of arc length, as we now explain.  Shown below in Figure is a portion of the parabola . Of course, this space curve may be parametrized by the vector-valued function defined by as shown on the left, where we see the location at a few different times . Notice that the points are not equally spaced on the curve.  A more natural parameter describing the points along the space curve is the distance traveled as we move along the parabola starting at the origin. For instance, the right side of Figure shows the points corresponding to various values of . We call this an arc length parametrization .   The parametrization (left) and a reparametrization by arc length.    To see that this is a more natural parametrization, consider an interstate highway cutting across a state. One way to parametrize the curve defined by the highway is to drive along the highway and record our position at every time, thus creating a function . If we encounter an accident or road construction, however, this parametrization might not be at all relevant to another person driving the same highway. An arc length parametrization, however, is like using the mile markers on the side of road to specify our position on the highway. If we know how far we've traveled along the highway, we know exactly where we are.  If we begin with a parametrization of a space curve, we can modify it to find an arc length parametrization, as we now describe. Suppose that the curve is parametrized by the vector-valued function where is in the interval . We define the parameter through the function which measures the length along the curve from to .  The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows us that and so   If we assume that is never 0, then for all and is always increasing. This should seem reasonable: unless we stop, the distance traveled along the curve increases as we move along the curve.  Since is an increasing function, it is invertible, which means we may view the time as a function of the distance traveled; that is, we have the relationship . We then obtain the arc length parametrization by composing with to obtain . Let's illustrate this with an example.   Consider a circle of radius in 2-space centered at the origin. We know that we can parameterize this circle as where runs from 0 to . We see that , and hence . It then follows that   Since , we may solve for in terms of to obtain . We then find the arc length parametrization by composing   More generally, for a circle of radius centered at the origin, a similar computation shows that is an arc length parametrization.   Notice that equation shows that so which means that we move along the curve with unit speed when we parameterize by arc length. This is clearly seen in Example where . It follows that the parameter is the distance traveled along the curve, as shown by:    In this activity we parameterize a line in 2-space in terms of arc length. Consider the line with parametric equations    To write in terms of , evaluate the integral to determine the length of the line from time 0 to time .    Use the formula from (a) for in terms of to write in terms of . Then explain why a parameterization of the line in terms of arc length is       A little more complicated example is the following.    Let us parameterize the curve defined by for in terms of arc length. To write in terms of we find in terms of :   Since , we can solve the equation (or ) for to obtain . So we can parameterize our curve in terms of arc length by     These examples illustrate a general method. Of course, evaluating an arc length integral and finding a formula for the inverse of a function can be difficult, so while this process is theoretically possible, it is not always practical to parameterize a curve in terms of arc length. However, we can guarantee that such a parameterization exists, and this observation plays an important role in the next section.    Curvature  For a smooth space curve, the curvature measures how fast the curve is bending or changing direction at a given point. For example, we expect that a line should have zero curvature everywhere, while a circle (which is bending the same at every point) should have constant curvature. Circles with larger radii should have smaller curvatures.  To measure the curvature, we first need to describe the direction of the curve at a point. We may do this using a continuously varying tangent vector to the curve, as shown at left in Figure . The direction of the curve is then determined by the angle each tangent vector makes with a horizontal vector, as shown at right in Figure .   Left: Tangent vectors to an ellipse. Right: Angles of tangent vectors.       Informally speaking, the curvature will be the rate at which the angle is changing as we move along the curve. Of course, this rate of change will depend on how we move along the curve; if we move with a greater speed along the curve, then will change more rapidly. This is why the speed limit is sometimes lowered when we enter a curve on a highway. In other words, the rate of change of will depend on the parametrization we use to describe the space curve. To eliminate this dependence on the parametrization, we choose to work with an arc length parametrization , which means we move along the curve with unit speed.  Using an arc length parametrization , we define the tangent vector , and note that ; that is, is a unit tangent vector. We then have , which means that   Therefore   This observation leads us to adopt the following definition.    If is a smooth space curve and is an arc length parameter for , then the curvature curvature , , of is     Note that is the Greek lowercase letter kappa .     We should expect that the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere. To show that our definition of curvature measures this correctly in 2-space, recall that gives us the arc length parameterization of a line. Use this information to explain why the curvature of a line is 0 everywhere.    Recall that an arc length parameterization of a circle in 2-space of radius centered at the origin is, from ,   Show that the curvature of this circle is the constant . What can you say about the relationship between the size of the radius of a circle and the value of its curvature? Why does this make sense?     The definition of curvature relies on our ability to parameterize curves in terms of arc length. Since we have seen that finding an arc length parametrization can be difficult, we would like to be able to express the curvature in terms of a more general parametrization .  To begin, we need to describe the vector , which is a vector tangent to the curve having unit length. Of course, the velocity vector is tangent to the curve; we simply need to normalize its length to be one. This means that we may take   Then the curvature of the curve defined by is   This last formula allows us to use any parameterization of a curve to calculate its curvature. There is another useful formula, given below, whose derivation is left for the exercises.   Formulas for curvature  If is a vector-valued function defining a smooth space curve , and if is not zero and if exists, then the curvature of satisfies         .       Use one of the two formulas for in terms of to help you answer the following questions.   The ellipse has parameterization Find the curvature of the ellipse. Assuming , at what points is the curvature the greatest and at what points is the curvature the smallest? Does this agree with your intuition?    The standard helix has parameterization . Find the curvature of the helix. Does the result agree with your intuition?      The curvature has another interpretation. Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point is the line that best approximates the curve at that point. The curvature at a point on a curve describes the circle that best approximates the curve at that point. Remembering that a circle of radius has curvature , then the circle that best approximates the curve near a point on a curve whose curvature is has radius and will be tangent to the tangent line at that point and has its center on the concave side of the curve. This circle, called the osculating circle of the curve at the point, is shown in Figure for a portion of a parabola.   The osculating circle      Summary    The integration process shows that the length of a smooth curve defined by on an interval is     Arc length is useful as a parameter because when we parameterize with respect to arc length, we eliminate the role of speed in our calculation of curvature and the result is a measure that depends only on the geometry of the curve and not on the parameterization of the curve.    We define the curvature of a curve in 2- or 3-space to be the rate of change of the magnitude of the unit tangent vector with respect to arc length, or       The WeBWorK problems are written by many different authors. Some authors use parentheses when writing vectors, e.g., instead of angle brackets . Please keep this in mind when working WeBWorK exercises.

In single variable calculus, we studied the notion of limit, which turned out to be a critical concept that formed the basis for the derivative and the definite integral. In this section we will begin to understand how the concept of limit for functions of two variables is similar to what we encountered for functions of a single variable. The limit will again be the fundamental idea in multivariable calculus, and we will use this notion of the limit of a function of several variables to define the important concept of differentiability later in this chapter. We have already seen its use in the derivatives of vector-valued functions in Section .  Let's begin by reviewing what we mean by the limit of a function of one variable. We say that a function has a limit as approaches provided that we can make the values as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . We denote this behavior by writing    We investigate the limits of several different functions by working with tables and graphs.   Consider the function defined by Complete Table .  Values of .                                What does the table suggest regarding ?    Explain how your results in (a) are reflected in Figure .  The graph of .       Next, consider Complete Table with values near , the point at which is not defined.  Values of .                                    What does this suggest about ?    Explain how your results in (c) are reflected in Figure .  The graph of .       Now, let's examine a function of two variables. Let Complete Table .  Values of .                                                            What does the table suggest about ?    Explain how your results in (e) are reflected in Figure . Compare this limit to the limit in part (a). How are the limits similar and how are they different?  Left: The graph of . Right: A contour plot.          Finally, consider which is not defined at . Complete Table . Round to three decimal places.  Values of .                                                              What does this suggest about ?    Explain how your results are reflected in Figure . Compare this limit to the limit in part (c). How are the results similar and how are they different?  Left: The graph of . Right: A contour plot.              Limits of Functions of Two Variables  In Preview Activity , we recalled the notion of limit from single variable calculus and saw that a similar concept applies to functions of two variables. Though we will focus on functions of two variables, for the sake of discussion, all the ideas we establish here are valid for functions of any number of variables. In a natural followup to our work in Preview Activity , we now formally define what it means for a function of two variables to have a limit at a point.    Given a function , we say that  has limit as approaches provided that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . We write     To investigate the limit of a single variable function, , we often consider the behavior of as approaches from the right and from the left. Similarly, we may investigate limits of two-variable functions, by considering the behavior of as approaches from various directions. This situation is more complicated because there are infinitely many ways in which may approach . In the next activity, we see how it is important to consider a variety of those paths in investigating whether or not a limit exists.   Consider the function , defined by whose graph is shown below in Figure    The graph of .      Is defined at the point ? What, if anything, does this say about whether has a limit at the point ?    Values of (to three decimal places) at several points close to are shown in Table .  Values of a function .                                                      Based on these calculations, state whether has a limit at and give an argument supporting your statement. (Hint: The blank spaces in the table are there to help you see the patterns.)    Now we formalize the conjecture from the previous part by considering what happens if we restrict our attention to different paths. First, we look at for points in the domain along the -axis; that is, we consider what happens when . What is the behavior of as ? If we approach by moving along the -axis, what value do we find as the limit?    What is the behavior of along the line when ; that is, what is the value of when ? If we approach by moving along the line in the first quadrant (thus considering as ), what value do we find as the limit?    In general, if , then approaches as approaches , regardless of the path we take in letting . Explain what the last two parts of this activity imply about the existence of .    Shown below in Figure is a set of contour lines of the function . What is the behavior of as approaches along any straight line? How does this observation reinforce your conclusion about the existence of from the previous part of this activity? (Hint: Use the fact that a non-vertical line has equation for some constant .)  Contour lines of .        As we have seen in Activity , if approaches along two different paths and we find that has two different limits, we can conclude that does not exist. This is similar to the one-variable example as shown in Figure ; does not exist because we see different limits as approaches 0 from the left and the right.   The graph of .    As a general rule, we have   Limits along different paths  If has two different limits as approaches along two different paths, then does not exist.   As the next activity shows, studying the limit of a two-variable function by considering the behavior of along various paths can require subtle insights.   Let's consider the function defined by and investigate the limit .   What is the behavior of on the -axis? That is, what is and what is the limit of as approaches along the -axis?    What is the behavior of on the -axis? That is, what is and what is the limit of as approaches along the -axis?    What is the behavior of on the line ? That is, what is and what is the limit of as approaches along the line ?    Based on what you have seen so far, do you think exists? If so, what do you think its value is?    Now consider the behavior of on the parabola ? What is and what is the limit of as approaches along this parabola?    State whether the limit exists or not and provide a justification of your statement.      This activity shows that we need to be careful when studying the limit of a two-variable functions by considering its behavior along different paths. If we find two different paths that result in two different limits, then we may conclude that the limit does not exist. However, we can never conclude that the limit of a function exists only by considering its behavior along different paths.  Generally speaking, concluding that a limit exists requires a more careful argument.   Consider the function defined by We want to know whether exists.  Note that if either or is 0, then . Therefore, if has a limit at , it must be 0. We will therefore argue that by showing that we can make as close to as we wish by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to . In what follows, we view and as being real numbers that are close, but not equal, to 0.  Since , we have which implies that   Multiplying both sides by and observing that for all gives   Thus, . Since as , we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close to (for this example, it turns out that we don't even need to worry about making close to 0). Therefore,    In spite of the fact that these two most recent examples illustrate some of the complications that arise when studying limits of two-variable functions, many of the properties that are familiar from our study of single variable functions hold in precisely the same way.   Properties of Limits  Let and be functions so that and both exist. Then     and       for any scalar                 if  .      We can use these properties and results from single variable calculus to verify that many limits exist. For example, these properties show that the function defined by has a limit at every point and, moreover,   The reason for this is that polynomial functions of a single variable have limits at every point.    Continuity  Recall that a function of a single variable is said to be continuous at provided that the following three conditions are satisfied:    exists,     exists, and     .     Using our understanding of limits of multivariable functions, we can define continuity in the same way.    A function is continuous continuity at the point provided that    is defined at the point ,     exists, and     .       For instance, we have seen that the function defined by is continous at every point. And just as with single variable functions, continuity has certain properties that are based on the properties of limits.   Properties of continuity  Let and be functions of two variables that are continuous at the point . Then    is continuous at for any scalar      is continuous at      is continuous at      is continuous at      is continuous at if       Using these properties, we can apply results from single variable calculus to decide about continuity of multivariable functions. For example, the coordinate functions and defined by and are continuous at every point. We can then use properties of continuity listed to conclude that every polynomial function in and is continuous at every point. For example, and are continuous functions, so their product is a continuous multivariable function.    Summary    A function has a limit at a point provided that we can make as close to as we like by taking sufficiently close (but not equal) to .    If has two different limits as approaches along two different paths, we can conclude that does not exist.    Properties similar to those for one-variable functions allow us to conclude that many limits exist and to evaluate them.    A function is continuous at a point in its domain if has a limit at and         Find the limits, if they exist, or type DNE for any which do not exist.   1) Along the -axis:  2) Along the -axis:  3) Along the line :  4) The limit is:                   dne       Determining the limit of a funtion   In this problem we show that the function does not have a limit as .  (a) Suppose that we consider along the curve . Find the limit in this case:    (b) Now consider along the curve . Find the limit in this case:    (c) Note that the results from (a) and (b) indicate that has no limit as  (be sure you can explain why!) .  To show this more generally, consider along the curve , for arbitrary . Find the limit in this case:    (Be sure that you can explain how this result also indicates that has no limit as .                  does not have a limit as approaches . (a) If tends to along the curve , then Therefore  (b) Similarly, if tends to along the curve , then and so Because we have two different values for these limits, we know that the function doesn't have a limit at . No matter how close we are to the origin, there will be points on that are close to and points that are close to , whereas for the limit to exist the function must get close to a single value. (c) We can see this more generally by considering the limit as tends to along the curve . Then so that and we see for every different value of we will get a different limiting value for the function. Thus the function does not have a limit at .        Show that the function does not have a limit at by examining the following limits.  (a) Find the limit of as along the line .    (b) Find the limit of as along the curve .    (Be sure that you are able to explain why the results in (a) and (b) indicate that does not have a limit at (0,0)!             (a) Let us suppose that approaches along the line . Then Therefore  (b) On the other hand, if approaches along the curve we have and so Thus no matter how close they are to the origin, there will be points such that is close to 0 and points such that is close to . So the limit does not exist.        Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type 'DNE' if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit, if it exists, or type N if it does not exist.                Find the limit (enter 'DNE' if the limit does not exist)  Hint: rationalize the denominator.

  "body": " First-Order Partial Derivatives     How are the first-order partial derivatives of a function of the independent variables and defined?    Given a function of the independent variables and , what do the first-order partial derivatives and tell us about ?      The derivative plays a central role in first semester calculus because it provides important information about a function. Thinking graphically, for instance, the derivative at a point tells us the slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. In addition, the derivative at a point also provides the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to changes in the independent variable.  Now that we are investigating functions of two or more variables, we can still ask how fast the function is changing, though we have to be careful about what we mean. Thinking graphically again, we can try to measure how steep the graph of the function is in a particular direction. Alternatively, we may want to know how fast a function's output changes in response to a change in one of the inputs. Over the next few sections, we will develop tools for addressing issues such as these. Preview Activity explores some issues with what we will come to call partial derivatives .   Suppose we take out an $18,000 car loan at interest rate and we agree to pay off the loan in years. The monthly payment, in dollars, is    What is the monthly payment if the interest rate is so that , and we pay the loan off in years?    Suppose the interest rate is fixed at .

Find the instantaneous rate of change and state the units on this quantity. What information does tell us about our car loan? What information does tell us about the graph you sketched in (b)?

Find the instantaneous rate of change and state the units on this quantity. What information does tell us about our car loan? What information does tell us about the graph you sketched in (d)?        First-Order Partial Derivatives  In Section , we studied the behavior of a function of two or more variables by considering the traces of the function. Recall that in one example, we considered the function defined by which measures the range, or horizontal distance, in feet, traveled by a projectile launched with an initial speed of feet per second at an angle radians to the horizontal. The graph of this function is given again on the left in Figure . Moreover, if we fix the angle , we may view the trace as a function of alone, as seen at right in Figure .   Left: The trace of with .       Since the trace is a one-variable function, we may consider its derivative just as we did in the first semester of calculus. With , we have and therefore   When , this gives which gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right of Figure . Thinking of this derivative as an instantaneous rate of change implies that if we increase the initial speed of the projectile by one foot per second, we expect the horizontal distance traveled to increase by approximately 8.74 feet if we hold the launch angle constant at radians.  By holding fixed and differentiating with respect to , we obtain the first-order partial derivative of with respect to . Denoting this partial derivative as , we have seen that   More generally, we have provided this limit exists.  In the same way, we may obtain a trace by setting, say, as shown in Figure .   The trace of with .       This gives and therefore   If we evaluate this quantity at , we have   Once again, the derivative gives the slope of the tangent line shown on the right in Figure . Thinking of the derivative as an instantaneous rate of change, we expect that the range of the projectile increases by 509.5 feet for every radian we increase the launch angle if we keep the initial speed of the projectile constant at 150 feet per second.  By holding fixed and differentiating with respect to , we obtain the first-order partial derivative of with respect to . As before, we denote this partial derivative as and write   As with the partial derivative with respect to , we may express this quantity more generally at an arbitrary point . To recap, we have now arrived at the formal definition of the first-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables.    The first-order partial derivatives of with respect to and partial derivatives first-order at a point are, respectively, provided the limits exist.     Consider the function defined by at the point .   Write the trace at the fixed value . On the left side of Figure , draw the graph of the trace with around the point where , indicating the scale and labels on the axes. Also, sketch the tangent line at the point .  Traces of .          Find the partial derivative and relate its value to the sketch you just made.    Write the trace at the fixed value . On the right side of Figure , draw the graph of the trace with indicating the scale and labels on the axes. Also, sketch the tangent line at the point .    Find the partial derivative and relate its value to the sketch you just made.      As these examples show, each partial derivative at a point arises as the derivative of a one-variable function defined by fixing one of the coordinates. In addition, we may consider each partial derivative as defining a new function of the point , just as the derivative defines a new function of in single-variable calculus. Due to the connection between one-variable derivatives and partial derivatives, we will often use Leibniz-style notation to denote partial derivatives by writing   To calculate the partial derivative , we hold fixed and thus we treat as a constant. In Leibniz notation, observe that   To see the contrast between how we calculate single variable derivatives and partial derivatives, and the difference between the notations and , observe that   Thus, computing partial derivatives is straightforward: we use the standard rules of single variable calculus, but do so while holding one (or more) of the variables constant.     If , find the partial derivatives and .    If , find the partial derivatives and .    If , find the partial derivatives and .    Assuming , find the partial derivatives , , and .    Find all possible first-order partial derivatives of        Interpretations of First-Order Partial Derivatives  Recall that the derivative of a single variable function has a geometric interpretation as the slope of the line tangent to the graph at a given point. Similarly, we have seen that the partial derivatives measure the slope of a line tangent to a trace of a function of two variables as shown in Figure .   Tangent lines to two traces of the distance function.       Now we consider the first-order partial derivatives in context. Recall that the difference quotient for a function of a single variable at a point where tells us the average rate of change of over the interval , while the derivative tells us the instantaneous rate of change of at . We can use these same concepts to explain the meanings of the partial derivatives in context.   The speed of sound traveling through ocean water is a function of temperature, salinity and depth. It may be modeled by the function   Here is the speed of sound in meters\/second, is the temperature in degrees Celsius, is the salinity in grams\/liter of water, and is the depth below the ocean surface in meters.   State the units in which each of the partial derivatives, , and , are expressed and explain the physical meaning of each.    Find the partial derivatives , and .    Evaluate each of the three partial derivatives at the point where , and . What does the sign of each partial derivatives tell us about the behavior of the function at the point ?        Using tables and contours to estimate partial derivatives  Remember that functions of two variables are often represented as either a table of data or a contour plot. In single variable calculus, we saw how we can use the difference quotient to approximate derivatives if, instead of an algebraic formula, we only know the value of the function at a few points. The same idea applies to partial derivatives.   The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how cold it feels outside when the wind is blowing. In Table , the wind chill , measured in degrees Fahrenheit, is a function of the wind speed , measured in miles per hour, and the ambient air temperature , also measured in degrees Fahrenheit. We thus view as being of the form .   Wind chill as a function of wind speed and temperature.

Summary    If is a function of two variables, there are two first order partial derivatives of : the partial derivative of with respect to , and the partial derivative of with respect to , where each partial derivative exists only at those points for which the limit exists.

Your monthly car payment in dollars is , where $ is the amount you borrowed, is the number of months it takes to pay off the loan, and percent is the interest rate.  (a) Is positive or negative?   ?    positive    negative    Suppose that your bank tells you that the magnitude of is 25.  What are the units of this value?  (For this problem, write our your units in full, writing dollars for $, months for months, percent for %, etc. Note that fractional units generally have a plural numerator and singular denominator.)  (b) Is positive or negative?   ?    positive    negative    Suppose that your bank tells you that the magnitude of is 5.  What are the units of this value?  (For this problem, write our your units in full, writing dollars for $, months for months, percent for %, etc. Note that fractional units generally have a plural numerator and singular denominator.)  For both parts of this problem, be sure you can explain what the practical meanings of the partial derivatives are.                       : The unit is dollars per month (dollars\/month). This is the rate at which payments change as the number of months it takes to pay off the loan changes. The sign is negative because payments decrease as the pay-off time increases. Thus dollars\/month. : The unit is dollars per percentage point (dollars\/percent). This is the rate at which payments change as the interest rate changes. The sign is positive because payments increase as the interest rate increases. Thus dollars\/percent.        An experiment to measure the toxicity of formaldehyde yielded the data in the table below. The values show the percent, , of rats surviving an exposure to formaldehyde at a concentration of (in parts per million, ppm) after months.              100  100  100  99  97  95     100  99  98  97  95  92     96  95  93  90  86  80     96  93  82  70  58  36    (a) Estimate :    (b) Estimate :    (Be sure that you can give the practical meaning of these two values in terms of formaldehyde toxicity.)             . (a) Thus, to estimate , we can take Alternately, we could take either of the two one-sided difference quotients, or In each case, the units of are percent per month. This says 20 months after rats are exposed to a formaldehyde concentration of 6 ppm, the percent of rats surviving is decreasing at a rate of about -1.75 per month. In other words, during the 20 month, around an additional -1.75 percent of the rats will die. (b) Proceeding similarly to find , we have or, with one-sided difference quotients, or These indicate that if the original concentration increases from 6 by 1 ppm, the percent surviving after 20 months decreases by about 2.08.        An airport can be cleared of fog by heating the air. The amount of heat required depends on the air temperature and the wetness of the fog. The figure below shows the heat required (in calories per cubic meter of fog) as a function of the temperature (in degrees Celsius) and the water content (in grams per cubic meter of fog). Note that this figure is not a contour diagram, but shows cross-sections of with fixed at , , , and .   (a) Estimate :    (Be sure you can interpret this partial derivative in practical terms.)

(a) The quantity is approximated by an difference quotient. The first partial derivative with respect to is approximated by for small . We are free to choose to find values from the figure we are given. If we take , we get the approximation (Note that you may get a different answer if you read different values from the graph.) The geometric meaning of the partial derivative that we just approximated is the slope of the curve shown in the figure in the text corresponding to at the point where . In practical terms, we have found that for fog at C containing 0.1 g water per m of fog, a C increase in temperature will reduce the heat requirement for dissipating the fog by about 1~calories per cubic meter of fog. (b) We can approximate values of from the figure, giving the table below:    0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4     120  240  330  450     100  190  260  350     80  160  220  300     70  130  200  280   This lets us approximate, using a difference quotient, each of the derivatives indicated. For , we have (We could, of course, use a left or central difference instead.) Similarly, we have:  (c) Using our table of values, we can similarly calculate the partial derivatives with respect to . For , we have (We could, of course, use a left or central difference instead.) Similarly, we have:          The Heat Index, , (measured in apparent degrees F ) is a function of the actual temperature outside (in degrees F) and the relative humidity (measured as a percentage).

Explain as best you can in the context of kinetic energy what the partial derivative tells us about kinetic energy.    Often we are given certain graphical information about a function instead of a rule. We can use that information to approximate partial derivatives. For example, suppose that we are given a contour plot of the kinetic energy function (as in Figure ) instead of a formula. Use this contour plot to approximate and as best you can. Compare to your calculations from earlier parts of this exercise.  The graph of .

Use a graphing utility to plot both the surface and the plane from (e) near the point . What is the relationship between the surface and the plane?       Recall from single variable calculus that, given the derivative of a single variable function and an initial condition, we can integrate to find the original function. We can sometimes use the same process for functions of more than one variable. For example, suppose that a function satisfies , , and .   Find all possible functions of and such that .

What do the second-order partial derivatives , , , and of a function tell us about the function's behavior?      Recall that for a single-variable function , the second derivative of is defined to be the derivative of the first derivative. That is, , which can be stated in terms of the limit definition of the derivative by writing   In what follows, we begin exploring the four different second-order partial derivatives of a function of two variables and seek to understand what these various derivatives tell us about the function's behavior.   Once again, let's consider the function defined by that measures a projectile's range as a function of its initial speed and launch angle . The graph of this function, including traces with and , is shown in Figure .   The distance function with traces and .          Compute the partial derivative . Notice that itself is a new function of and , so we may now compute the partial derivatives of . Find the partial derivative and show that .     Figure shows the trace of with with three tangent lines included. Explain how your result from part (a) of this preview activity is reflected in this figure.  The trace with .       Determine the partial derivative , and then find the partial derivative . Evaluate .  More traces of the range function.        Figure shows the trace and includes three tangent lines. Explain how the value of is reflected in this figure.    Because and are each functions of both and , they each have two partial derivatives. Not only can we compute , but also ; likewise, in addition to , but also . For the range function , use your earlier computations of and to now determine and . Write one sentence to explain how you calculated these mixed partial derivatives.        Second-Order Partial Derivatives  A function of two independent variables and has two first order partial derivatives, and . As we saw in Preview Activity , each of these first-order partial derivatives has two partial derivatives, giving a total of four second-order partial derivatives partial derivatives second-order :    ,     ,     ,     .     The first two are called unmixed second-order partial derivatives partial derivatives second-order, unmixed while the last two are called the mixed second-order partial derivatives partial derivatives second-order, mixed .  One aspect of this notation can be a little confusing. The notation means that we first differentiate with respect to and then with respect to ; this can be expressed in the alternate notation . However, to find the second partial derivative we first differentiate with respect to and then . This means that   Be sure to note carefully the difference between Leibniz notation and subscript notation and the order in which and appear in each. In addition, remember that anytime we compute a partial derivative, we hold constant the variable(s) other than the one we are differentiating with respect to.   Find all second order partial derivatives of the following functions. For each partial derivative you calculate, state explicitly which variable is being held constant.                  How many second order partial derivatives does the function defined by have? Find and (you do not need to find the other second order partial derivatives).      In Preview Activity and Activity , you may have noticed that the mixed second-order partial derivatives are equal. This observation holds generally and is known as Clairaut's Theorem.   Clairaut's Theorem  Let be a function of several variables for which the partial derivatives and are continuous near the point . Then      Interpreting the Second-Order Partial Derivatives  Recall from single variable calculus that the second derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the derivative. This observation is the key to understanding the meaning of the second-order partial derivatives.   The tangent lines to a trace with increasing .        Furthermore, we remember that the second derivative of a function at a point provides us with information about the concavity of the function at that point. Since the unmixed second-order partial derivative requires us to hold constant and differentiate twice with respect to , we may simply view as the second derivative of a trace of where is fixed. As such, will measure the concavity of this trace.  Consider, for example, . Figure shows the graph of this function along with the trace given by . Also shown are three tangent lines to this trace, with increasing -values from left to right among the three plots in Figure .  That the slope of the tangent line is decreasing as increases is reflected, as it is in one-variable calculus, in the fact that the trace is concave down. Indeed, we see that and so , since for all values of , including .  In the following activity, we further explore what second-order partial derivatives tell us about the geometric behavior of a surface.   We continue to consider the function defined by .   In Figure , we see the trace of that has held constant with . We also see three different lines that are tangent to the trace of in the direction at values of that are increasing from left to right in the figure.

  "body": " Linearization: Tangent Planes and Differentials     What does it mean for a function of two variables to be locally linear at a point?    How do we find the equation of the plane tangent to a locally linear function at a point?    What is the differential of a multivariable function of two variables and what are its uses?      One of the central concepts in single variable calculus is that the graph of a differentiable function, when viewed on a very small scale, looks like a line. We call this line the tangent line and measure its slope with the derivative. In this section, we will extend this concept to functions of several variables.  Let's see what happens when we look at the graph of a two-variable function on a small scale. To begin, let's consider the function defined by whose graph is shown in Figure .   The graph of .    We choose to study the behavior of this function near the point . In particular, we wish to view the graph on an increasingly small scale around this point, as shown in the two plots in Figure    The graph of .       Just as the graph of a differentiable single-variable function looks like a line when viewed on a small scale, we see that the graph of this particular two-variable function looks like a plane, as seen in Figure . In the following preview activity, we explore how to find the equation of this plane.   The graph of .    In what follows, we will also use the important fact As we saw in Section , the equation of a plane passing through the point may be written in the form . If the plane is not vertical, then , and we can rearrange this and hence write and thus where and , respectively. that the plane passing through may be expressed in the form , where and are constants.   Let , and let .   Evaluate and its partial derivatives at ; that is, find , , and .    We know one point on the tangent plane; namely, the -value of the tangent plane agrees with the -value on the graph of at the point . In other words, both the tangent plane and the graph of the function contain the point . Use this observation to determine in the expression .    Sketch the traces of for and below in Figure .  The traces of with and .          Determine the equation of the tangent line of the trace that you sketched in the previous part with (in the direction) at the point .  The traces of and the tangent plane.           Figure shows the traces of the function and the traces of the tangent plane. Explain how the tangent line of the trace of , whose equation you found in the last part of this activity, is related to the tangent plane. How does this observation help you determine the constant in the equation for the tangent plane ? (Hint: How do you think should be related to ?)    In a similar way to what you did in (d), determine the equation of the tangent line of the trace with at the point . Explain how this tangent line is related to the tangent plane, and use this observation to determine the constant in the equation for the tangent plane . (Hint: How do you think should be related to ?)    Finally, write the equation of the tangent plane to the graph of at the point .        The Tangent Plane  Before stating the formula for the equation of the tangent plane at a point for a general function , we need to discuss a technical condition. As we have noted, when we look at the graph of a single-variable function on a small scale near a point , we expect to see a line; in this case, we say that is locally linear near since the graph looks like a linear function locally around . Of course, there are functions, such as the absolute value function given by , that are not locally linear at every point. In single-variable calculus, we learn that if the derivative of a function exists at a point, then the function is guaranteed to be locally linear there.  In a similar way, we say that a two-variable function is locally linear function locally linear near provided that the graph of looks like a plane (its tangent plane ) when viewed on a small scale near . How can we tell when a function of two variables is locally linear at a point?  It is not unreasonable to expect that if and exist for some function at a point , then is locally linear at . This is not sufficient, however. As an example, consider the function defined by . In Exercise you are asked to show that and both exist, but that is not locally linear at (see Figure ). So the existence of the two first order partial derivatives at a point does not guarantee local linearity at that point.  It would take us too far afield to provide a rigorous dicussion of differentiability of functions of more than one variable (see Exercise for a little more detail), so we will be content to define stronger, but more easily verified, conditions that ensure local linearity.   Differentiablity  If is a function of the independent variables and and both and exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point , then is continuously differentiable function continuously differentiable at .   As a consequence, whenever a function is continuously differentiable at a point , it follows that the function has a tangent plane at . Viewed up close, the tangent plane and the function are then virtually indistinguishable. (We won't formally define differentiability of multivariable functions here, and for our purposes continuous differentiability is the only condition we will ever need to use. It is important to note that continuous differentiability is a stronger condition than differentiability. All of the results we encounter will apply to differentiable functions, and so also apply to continuously differentiable functions.) In addition, as in Preview Activity , we find the following general formula for the tangent plane.   The tangent plane  If has continuous first-order partial derivatives, then the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of at the point is     Important Note: As can be seen in Exercise , it is possible that and can exist for a function , and so the plane exists even though is not locally linear at (because the graph of does not look linear when we zoom in around the point ). In such a case this plane is not tangent to the graph. Differentiability for a function of two variables implies the existence of a tangent plane, but the existence of the two first order partial derivatives of a function at a point does not imply differentiaility. This is quite different than what happens in single variable calculus.  Finally, one important note about the form of the equation for the tangent plane, . Say, for example, that we have the particular tangent plane . Observe that we can immediately read from this form that and ; furthermore, is the slope of the trace to both and the tangent plane in the -direction at . In the same way, is the slope of the trace of both and the tangent plane in the -direction at .     Find the equation of the tangent plane to at the point . Simplify as much as possible. Does the result surprise you? Explain.    Find the equation of the tangent plane to at the point .       Linearization  In single variable calculus, an important use of the tangent line is to approximate the value of a differentiable function. Near the point , the tangent line to the graph of at is close to the graph of near , as shown in Figure .   The linearization of the single-variable function .       In this single-variable setting, we let denote the function whose graph is the tangent line, and thus   Furthermore, observe that near . We call the linearization of .  In the same way, the tangent plane to the graph of a differentiable function at a point provides a good approximation of near . Here, we define the linearization, , to be the two-variable function whose graph is the tangent plane, and thus   Finally, note that for points near . This is illustrated in Figure .   The linearization of .     In what follows, we find the linearization of several different functions that are given in algebraic, tabular, or graphical form.   Find the linearization for the function defined by at the point . Then use the linearization to estimate the value of .

Wind chill as a function of wind speed and temperature.                                                                                                                                  Use the data to first estimate the appropriate partial derivatives, and then find the linearization at the point . Finally, use the linearization to estimate , , and . Compare your results to what you obtained in Activity      Figure gives a contour plot of a continuously differentiable function .  A contour plot of .   After estimating appropriate partial derivatives, determine the linearization at the point , and use it to estimate , , and .        Differentials  As we have seen, the linearization enables us to estimate the value of for points near the base point . Sometimes, however, we are more interested in the change in as we move from the base point to another point .   The differential approximates the change in .     Figure illustrates this situation. Suppose we are at the point , and we know the value of at . If we consider the displacement to a new point , we would like to know how much the function has changed. We denote this change by , where   A simple way to estimate the change is to approximate it by , which represents the change in the linearization as we move from to . This gives   For consistency, we will denote the change in the independent variables as and , and thus   Expressed equivalently in Leibniz notation, we have   We call the quantities , , and  differentials differentials , and we think of them as measuring small changes in the quantities , , and . Equations and express the relationship between these changes. Equation resembles an important idea from single-variable calculus: when depends on , it follows in the notation of differentials that   We will illustrate the use of differentials with an example.   Suppose we have a machine that manufactures rectangles of width cm and height cm. However, the machine isn't perfect, and therefore the width could be off by cm and the height could be off by cm.  The area of the rectangle is so that the area of a perfectly manufactured rectangle is square centimeters. Since the machine isn't perfect, we would like to know how much the area of a given manufactured rectangle could differ from the perfect rectangle. We will estimate the uncertainty in the area using , and find that   Since and , we have   That is, we estimate that the area in our rectangles could be off by as much as 10 square centimeters.    The questions in this activity explore the differential in several different contexts.   Suppose that the elevation of a landscape is given by the function , where we additionally know that , , and . Assume that and are measured in miles in the easterly and northerly directions, respectively, from some base point . Your GPS device says that you are currently at the point . However, you know that the coordinates are only accurate to within units; that is, and . Estimate the uncertainty in your elevation using differentials.    The pressure, volume, and temperature of an ideal gas are related by the equation where is measured in kilopascals, in liters, and in kelvin. Find the pressure when the volume is 12 liters and the temperature is 310 K. Use differentials to estimate the change in the pressure when the volume increases to 12.3 liters and the temperature decreases to 305 K.    Refer to Table , the table of values of the wind chill , in degrees Fahrenheit, as a function of temperature, also in degrees Fahrenheit, and wind speed, in miles per hour. Suppose your anemometer says the wind is blowing at miles per hour and your thermometer shows a reading of degrees. However, you know your thermometer is only accurate to within degrees and your anemometer is only accurate to within miles per hour. What is the wind chill based on your measurements? Estimate the uncertainty in your measurement of the wind chill.        Summary    A function of two independent variables is locally linear at a point if the graph of looks like a plane as we zoom in on the graph around the point . In this case, the equation of the tangent plane is given by     The tangent plane , when considered as a function, is called the linearization of a differentiable function at and may be used to estimate values of ; that is, for points near .    A function of two independent variables is differentiable at provided that both and exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point .    The differential of a function is related to the differentials and by We can use this relationship to approximate small changes in that result from small changes in and .

To check this, observe that the increments in each row (column) are equal, or nearly so. The second table is more linear due to finer data. (c) From either table we see that . Also, using the second table,  Using these estimates for the partial derivatives, we get that the local linearization of around is Now we use and , giving we have the local linearization of around  Note that these agree to a reasonable number of decimal places.

Let be the function defined by , whose graph is shown in Figure .   The surface for .      Determine What does this limit tell us about ?    Note that , and this symmetry implies that . So both partial derivatives of exist at . A picture of the surface defined by near is shown in Figure . Based on this picture, do you think is locally linear at ? Why?    Show that the curve where on the surface defined by is not differentiable at 0. What does this tell us about the local linearity of at ?    Is the function defined by locally linear at ?

Clearly show your work and thinking.       In the following questions, we determine and apply the linearization for several different functions.   Find the linearization for the function defined by at the point . Use the linearization to estimate the value of . Compare your estimate to the actual value of .    The Heat Index, , (measured in apparent degrees F) is a function of the actual temperature outside (in degrees F) and the relative humidity (measured as a percentage). A portion of the table which gives values for this function, , is provided in Table .  Heat index.    T   H                                     Suppose you are given that and . Use this given information and one other value from the table to estimate the value of using the linearization at . Using proper terminology and notation, explain your work and thinking.    Just as we can find a local linearization for a differentiable function of two variables, we can do so for functions of three or more variables. By extending the concept of the local linearization from two to three variables, find the linearization of the function at the point . Then, use the linearization to estimate the value of .       In the following questions, we investigate two different applied settings using the differential.   Let represent the vertical displacement in centimeters from the rest position of a string (like a guitar string) as a function of the distance in centimeters from the fixed left end of the string and the time in seconds after the string has been plucked. (An interesting video of this can be seen at https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TKF6nFzpHBUA .) A simple model for could be Use the differential to approximate how much more this vibrating string is vertically displaced from its position at if we decrease by cm and increase the time by seconds. Compare to the value of at the point .    Resistors used in electrical circuits have colored bands painted on them to indicate the amount of resistance and the possible error in the resistance. When three resistors, whose resistances are , , and , are connected in parallel, the total resistance is given by Suppose that the resistances are , , and . Find the total resistance . If you know each of , , and with a possible error of %, estimate the maximum error in your calculation of .       In this section we argued that if is a function of two variables and if and both exist and are continuous in an open disk containing the point , then is differentiable at . This condition ensures that is differentiable at , but it does not define what it means for to be differentiable at . In this exercise we explore the definition of differentiability of a function of two variables in more detail. Throughout, let be the function defined by .   Use appropriate technology to plot the graph of on the domain . Explain why is not locally linear at .    Show that both and exist. If is locally linear at , what must be the equation of the tangent plane to at ?    Recall that if a function of a single variable is differentiable at , then exists. We saw in single variable calculus that the existence of means that the graph of is locally linear at . In other words, the graph of looks like its linearization for close to . That is, the values of can be closely approximated by as long as is close to . We can measure how good the approximation of is to with the error function As approaches , approaches , and so provides increasingly better approximations to as gets closer to . Show that, even though is not locally linear at , its error term at has a limit of as approaches . (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to as approaches , we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at .    As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider as a function of one variable. If we let , where is the distance from to , then the relative error in approximating with is Show that, for a function of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is as approaches .    Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point. So we use the concept of relative error to define differentiability of a function of two variables. When we consider differentiability of a function at a point , then if and , the distance from to is .      A function is differentiable at a point differentiable function if there is a linear function such that the relative error has at limit of at , where , , and .    A function is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point in its domain. The function in the definition is the linearization of at . Verify that is not differentiable at by showing that the relative error at does not have a limit at . Conclude that the existence of partial derivatives at a point is not enough to ensure differentiability at that point. (Hint: Consider the limit along different paths.)       Suppose that a function is differentiable at a point . Let as in the conditions of Definition . Show that and . (Hint: Calculate the limits of the relative errors when and .)    We know that if a function of a single variable is differentiable at a point, then that function is also continuous at that point. In this exercise we determine that the same property holds for functions of two variables. A function of the two variables and is continuous at a point in its domain if or (letting and , Show that if is differentiable at , then is continuous at . (Hint: Multiply both sides of the equality that comes from differentiability by .)    "

Show that, even though is not locally linear at , its error term at has a limit of as approaches . (Use the linearization you found in part (b).) This shows that just because an error term goes to as approaches , we cannot conclude that a function is locally linear at .    As the previous part illustrates, having the error term go to does not ensure that a function of two variables is locally linear. Instead, we need a notation of a relative error. To see how this works, let us return to the single variable case for a moment and consider as a function of one variable. If we let , where is the distance from to , then the relative error in approximating with is Show that, for a function of a single variable, the limit of the relative error is as approaches .    Even though the error term for a function of two variables might have a limit of at a point, our example shows that the function may not be locally linear at that point.

  "body": " The Chain Rule     What is the Chain Rule and how do we use it to find a derivative?    How can we use a tree diagram to guide us in applying the Chain Rule?      In single-variable calculus, we encountered situations in which some quantity depends on and, in turn, depends on . A change in produces a change in , which consequently produces a change in . Using the language of differentials that we saw in the previous section, these changes are naturally related by   In terms of instantaneous rates of change, we then have and thus   This most recent equation we call the Chain Rule .  In the case of a function of two variables where , it might be that both and depend on another variable . A change in then produces changes in both and , which then cause to change. In this section we will see how to find the change in that is caused by a change in , leading us to multivariable versions of the Chain Rule involving both regular and partial derivatives.   Suppose you are driving around in the -plane in such a way that your position at time is given by function   The path taken is shown on the left of Figure .   Left: Your position in the plane. Right: The corresponding temperature.       Suppose, furthermore, that the temperature at a point in the plane is given by and note that the surface generated by is shown on the right of Figure . Therefore, as time passes, your position changes, and, as your position changes, the temperature also changes.   The position function provides a parameterization and of the position at time . By substituting for and for in the formula for , we can write as a function of . Make these substitutions to write as a function of and then use the Chain Rule from single variable calculus to find . (Do not do any algebra to simplify the derivative, either before taking the derivative, nor after.)    Now we want to understand how the result from part (a) can be obtained from as a multivariable function. Recall from the previous section that small changes in and produce a change in that is approximated by The Chain Rule tells us about the instantaneous rate of change of , and this can be found as Use equation to explain why the instantaneous rate of change of that results from a change in is     Using the original formulas for , , and in the problem statement, calculate all of the derivatives in Equation (with and in terms of and , and and in terms of ), and hence write the right-hand side of Equation in terms of , , and .    Compare the results of parts (a) and (c). Write a couple of sentences that identify specifically how each term in (c) relates to a corresponding terms in (a). This connection between parts (a) and (c) provides a multivariable version of the Chain Rule.        The Chain Rule  As Preview Activity suggests, the following version of the Chain Rule holds in general.   The Chain Rule  Let , where is a differentiable function of the independent variables and , and let and each be differentiable functions of an independent variable . Then    It is important to note the differences among the derivatives in . Since is a function of the two variables and , the derivatives in the Chain Rule for with respect to and are partial derivatives. However, since and are functions of the single variable , their derivatives are the standard derivatives of functions of one variable. When we compose with and , we then have as a function of the single variable , making the derivative of with respect to a standard derivative from single variable calculus as well.  To understand why this Chain Rule works in general, suppose that some quantity depends on and so that   Next, suppose that and each depend on another quantity , so that   Combining Equations and , we find that which is the Chain Rule in this particular context, as expressed in Equation .   In the following questions, we apply the Chain Rule in several different contexts.    Suppose that we have a function defined by . In addition, suppose that and are restricted to points that move around the plane by following a circle of radius centered at the origin that is parameterized by     Use the Chain Rule to find the resulting instantaneous rate of change .    Substitute for and for in the rule for to write in terms of and calculate directly. Compare to the result of part (i.).      Suppose that the temperature on a metal plate is given by the function with where the temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and and are each measured in feet.    Find and . What are the units on these partial derivatives?    Suppose an ant is walking along the -axis at the rate of 2 feet per minute toward the origin. When the ant is at the point , what is the instantaneous rate of change in the temperature that the ant experiences. Include units on your response.    Suppose instead that the ant walks along an ellipse with and , where is measured in minutes. Find at , , and . What does this seem to tell you about the path along which the ant is walking?      Suppose that you are walking along a surface whose elevation is given by a function . Furthermore, suppose that if you consider how your location corresponds to points in the -plane, you know that when you pass the point , your velocity vector is . If some contours of are as shown in Figure , estimate the rate of change when you pass through .  Some contours of .          Tree Diagrams  Up to this point, we have applied the Chain Rule to situations where we have a function of variables and , with both and depending on another single quantity . We may apply the Chain Rule, however, when and each depend on more than one quantity, or when is a function of more than two variables. It can be challenging to keep track of all the dependencies among the variables, and thus a tree diagram can be a useful tool to organize our work. For example, suppose that depends on and , and and both depend on . We may represent these relationships using the tree diagram shown at left Figure . We place the dependent variable at the top of the tree and connect it to the variables on which it depends one level below. We then connect each of those variables to the variable on which each depends.   A tree diagram illustrating dependencies.       To represent the Chain Rule, we label every edge of the diagram with the appropriate derivative or partial derivative, as seen at right in Figure . To calculate an overall derivative according to the Chain Rule, we construct the product of the derivatives along all paths connecting the variables and then add all of these products. For example, the diagram at right in Figure illustrates the Chain Rule       Figure shows the tree diagram we construct when (a) depends on , , and , (b) , , and each depend on and , and (c) and depend on .  Three levels of dependencies      Label the edges with the appropriate derivatives.    Use the Chain Rule to write .       Suppose that and that    Construct a tree diagram representing the dependencies of on and and and on and .    Use the tree diagram to find .    Now suppose that and . Find the values of and that correspond to these given values of and , and then use the Chain Rule to find the value of the partial derivative .          Summary    The Chain Rule is a tool for differentiating a composite for functions. In its simplest form, it says that if is a function of two variables and and depend on , then     A tree diagram can be used to represent the dependence of variables on other variables. By following the links in the tree diagram, we can form chains of partial derivatives or derivatives that can be combined to give a desired partial derivative.

  "body": " Directional Derivatives and the Gradient     The partial derivatives of a function tell us the rate of change of in the direction of the coordinate axes. How can we measure the rate of change of in other directions?    What is the gradient of a function and what does it tell us?      The partial derivatives of a function tell us the instantaneous rate at which the function changes as we hold all but one independent variable constant and allow the remaining independent variable to change. It is natural to wonder how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in directions other than parallel to a coordinate axes. In what follows, we investigate this question, and see how the rate of change in any given direction is connected to the rates of change given by the standard partial derivatives.   Let's consider the function defined by and suppose that measures the temperature, in degrees Celsius, at a given point in the plane, where and are measured in feet. Assume that the positive -axis points due east, while the positive -axis points due north. A contour plot of is shown in Figure    A contour plot of .      Suppose that a person is walking due east, and thus parallel to the -axis. At what instantaneous rate is the temperature changing with respect to at the moment the walker passes the point ? What are the units on this rate of change?    Next, determine the instantaneous rate of change of temperature with respect to distance at the point if the person is instead walking due north. Again, include units on your result.    Now, rather than walking due east or due north, let's suppose that the person is walking with velocity given by the vector , where time is measured in seconds. Note that the person's speed is thus feet per second. Find parametric equations for the person's path; that is, parameterize the line through using the direction vector . Let denote the -coordinate of the line, and its -coordinate. Make sure your parameterization places the walker at the point when .    With the parameterization in (c), we can now view the temperature as not only a function of and , but also of time, . Hence, use the chain rule to determine the value of . What are the units on your answer? What is the practical meaning of this result?       Directional Derivatives  Given a function , the partial derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of as only the variable changes; likewise, measures the rate of change of at as only changes. Note particularly that is measured in units of per unit of change in , and that the units on are similar.  In Preview Activity , we saw how we could measure the rate of change of in a situation where both and were changing; in that activity, however, we found that this rate of change was measured in units of per unit of time . In a given unit of time, we may move more than one unit of distance. In fact, in Preview Activity , in each unit increase in time we move a distance of feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of our choice, we instead want to have a rate of change whose units are units of per unit of distance in the given direction.   In this light, in order to formally define the derivative in a particular direction of motion, we want to represent the change in for a given unit change in the direction of motion. We can represent this unit change in direction with a unit vector, say . If we move a distance in the direction of from a fixed point , we then arrive at the new point . It now follows that the slope of the secant line to the curve on the surface through in the direction of through the points and is   To get the instantaneous rate of change of in the direction , we must take the limit of the quantity in Equation as . Doing so results in the formal definition of the directional derivative.    Let be given. The derivative of at the point in the direction of the unit vector directional derivative is denoted and is given by for those values of and for which the limit exists.    The quantity is called a directional derivative . When we evaluate the directional derivative at a point , the result tells us the instantaneous rate at which changes at per unit increase in the direction of the vector . In addition, the quantity tells us the slope of the line tangent to the surface in the direction of at the point .    Computing the Directional Derivative  In a similar way to how we developed shortcut rules for standard derivatives in single variable calculus, and for partial derivatives in multivariable calculus, we can also find a way to evaluate directional derivatives without resorting to the limit definition found in Equation . We do so using a very similar approach to our work in Preview Activity .  Suppose we consider the situation where we are interested in the instantaneous rate of change of at a point in the direction , where is a unit vector. The variables and are therefore changing according to the parameterization   Observe that and for all values of . Since is a unit vector, it follows that a point moving along this line moves one unit of distance per one unit of time; that is, each single unit of time corresponds to movement of a single unit of distance in that direction. This observation allows us to use the Chain Rule to calculate the directional derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change of with respect to change in the direction .  In particular, by the Chain Rule, it follows that   This now allows us to compute the directional derivative at an arbitrary point according to the following formula.   Calculating a directional derivative  Given a differentiable function and a unit vector , we may compute by     Note well: To use Equation , we must have a unit vector in the direction of motion. In the event that we have a direction prescribed by a non-unit vector, we must first scale the vector to have length 1.   Let .   Determine and .    Use Equation to determine and . What familiar function is ? What familiar function is ? (Recall that is the unit vector in the positive -direction and is the unit vector in the positive -direction.)    Use Equation to find the derivative of in the direction of the vector at the point . Remember that a unit direction vector is needed.        The Gradient  Via the Chain Rule, we have seen that for a given function , its instantaneous rate of change in the direction of a unit vector is given by   Recalling that the dot product of two vectors and is computed by we see that we may recast Equation in a way that has geometric meaning. In particular, we see that is the dot product of the vector and the vector .  We call this vector formed by the partial derivatives of the gradient of and denote it   We read as the gradient of ,  grad or del . The symbol is called nabla , which comes from a Greek word for a certain type of harp that has a similar shape. Notice that varies from point to point, and also provides an alternate formulation of the directional derivative.  The directional derivative and the gradient  Given a differentiable function and a unit vector , we may compute by   In the following activity, we investigate some of what the gradient tells us about the behavior of a function .   Let's consider the function defined by . Some contours for this function are shown in Figure .   Contours of .      Find the gradient .    For each of the following points , evaluate the gradient and sketch the gradient vector with its tail at . Some of the vectors are too long to fit onto the plot, but we'd like to draw them to scale; to do so, scale each vector by a factor of 1\/4.                                         What do you notice about the relationship between the gradient at and the contour passing through that point?    Does increase or decrease in the direction of ? Provide a justification for your response.     As a vector, defines a direction and a length. As we will soon see, both of these convey important information about the behavior of near .    The Direction of the Gradient  Remember that the dot product also conveys information about the angle between the two vectors. If is the angle between and (where is a unit vector), then we also have that   In particular, when is a right angle, as shown on the left of Figure , then , because . Since the value of the directional derivative is 0, this means that is unchanging in this direction, and hence must be tangent to the contour of that passes through . In other words, is orthogonal to the contour through . This shows that the gradient vector at a given point is always perpendicular to the contour passing through the point, confirming that what we saw in part (c) of Activity holds in general.   The sign of is determined by .        Moreover, when is an acute angle, it follows that so since and therefore , as shown in the middle image in Figure . This means that is increasing in any direction where is acute. In a similar way, when is an obtuse angle, then so , as seen on the right in Figure . This means that is decreasing in any direction for which is obtuse.  Finally, as we can see in the following activity, we may also use the gradient to determine the directions in which the function is increasing and decreasing most rapidly.   In this activity we investigate how the gradient is related to the directions of greatest increase and decrease of a function. Let be a differentiable function and a unit vector.   Let be the angle between and . Use the relationship between the dot product and the angle between two vectors to explain why     At the point , the only quantity in Equation that can change is (which determines the direction of travel). Explain why makes the quantity as large as possible.    When , in what direction does the unit vector point relative to ? Why? What does this tell us about the direction of greatest increase of at the point ?    In what direction, relative to , does decrease most rapidly at the point ?    State the unit vectors and (in terms of ) that provide the directions of greatest increase and decrease for the function at the point . What important assumption must we make regarding in order for these vectors to exist?        The Length of the Gradient  Having established in Activity that the direction in which a function increases most rapidly at a point is the unit vector in the direction of the gradient, (that is, , provided that ), it is also natural to ask, in the direction of greatest increase for at , what is the value of the rate of increase? In this situation, we are asking for the value of where .  Using the now familiar way to compute the directional derivative, we see that   Next, we recall two important facts about the dot product: (i) for any scalar , and (ii) . Applying these properties to the most recent equation involving the directional derivative, we find that   Finally, since is a nonzero vector, its length is a nonzero scalar, and thus we can simplify the preceding equation to establish that   We summarize our most recent work by stating two important facts about the gradient.   Important facts about the gradient  Let be a differentiable function and a point for which . Then points in the direction of greatest increase of at , and the instantaneous rate of change of in that direction is the length of the gradient vector. That is, if , then is a unit vector in the direction of greatest increase of at , and .    Consider the function defined by .   Find the gradient and sketch it on Figure .  A plot for the gradient .       Sketch the unit vector on Figure with its tail at . Now find the directional derivative .    What is the slope of the graph of in the direction ? What does the sign of the directional derivative tell you?    Consider the vector and sketch on Figure with its tail at . Find a unit vector pointing in the same direction of . Without computing , what do you know about the sign of this directional derivative? Now verify your observation by computing .    In which direction (that is, for what unit vector ) is the greatest? What is the slope of the graph in this direction?    Corresponding, in which direction is least? What is the slope of the graph in this direction?    Sketch two unit vectors for which and then find component representations of these vectors.    Suppose you are standing at the point . In which direction should you move to cause to increase as rapidly as possible? At what rate does increase in this direction?        Applications  The gradient finds many natural applications. For example, situations often arise for instance, constructing a road through the mountains or planning the flow of water across a landscape where we are interested in knowing the direction in which a function is increasing or decreasing most rapidly.  For example, consider a two-dimensional version of how a heat-seeking missile might work.(This application is borrowed from United States Air Force Academy Department of Mathematical Sciences.) Suppose that the temperature surrounding a fighter jet can be modeled by the function defined by where is a point in the plane of the fighter jet and is measured in degrees Celsius. Some contours and gradients are shown on the left in Figure .   Contours and gradient for and the missile's path.       A heat-seeking missile will always travel in the direction in which the temperature increases most rapidly; that is, it will always travel in the direction of the gradient . If a missile is fired from the point , then its path will be that shown on the right in Figure .  In the final activity of this section, we consider several questions related to this context of a heat-seeking missile, and foreshadow some upcoming work in Section .     The temperature has its maximum value at the fighter jet's location. State the fighter jet's location and explain how Figure tells you this.    Determine at the fighter jet's location and give a justification for your response.    Suppose that a different function has a local maximum value at . Sketch the behavior of some possible contours near this point. What is ? (Hint: What is the direction of greatest increase in at the local maximum?)    Suppose that a function has a local minimum value at . Sketch the behavior of some possible contours near this point. What is ?    If a function has a local minimum at , what is the direction of greatest increase of at ?       Summary    The directional derivative of at the point in the direction of the unit vector is for those values of and for which the limit exists. In addition, measures the slope of the graph of when we move in the direction . Alternatively, measures the instantaneous rate of change of in the direction at .    The gradient of a function at a point is the vector     The directional derivative in the direction may be computed by     At any point where the gradient is nonzero, gradient is orthogonal to the contour through that point and points in the direction in which increases most rapidly; moreover, the slope of in this direction equals the length of the gradient . Similarly, the opposite of the gradient points in the direction of greatest decrease, and that rate of decrease is the opposite of the length of the gradient.        Consider the function .  Find the gradient of :  , ,  Find the gradient of at the point (5, -5, 3).  , ,  Find the rate of change of the function at the point (5, -5,3) in the direction .                                            If , find the value of the directional derivative at the point in the direction given by the angle .

What is the value of this most negative rate of change, that is, the minimum value of the directional derivative at ?    E                            SOLUTION  (a) Let be constant. The level curves have equation or . If , these equations represent circles in the - plane.  (b) The largest value of the temperature is attained at .  The value of the temperature at this point is  (c) The greatest increase in temperature at is in the direction of the gradient at the point.  We have  The maximum value of the directional derivative at is given by the magnitude of the gradient at :  (c) The greatest decrease in temperature at is in the opposite direction of the gradient at the point:  The minimum value of the directional derivative at is given by         The temperature at a point (x,y,z) is given by , where is measured in degrees Celsius and x,y, and z in meters. There are lots of places to make silly errors in this problem; just try to keep track of what needs to be a unit vector.

Now we want rate of change with respect to time. If we move at 7 cm\/sec:          At a certain point on a heated metal plate, the greatest rate of temperature increase, 5 degrees Celsius per meter, is toward the northeast. If an object at this point moves directly north, at what rate is the temperature increasing?  degrees Celsius per meter        SOLUTION  Let be the temperature function and the point. The value of the greatest rate of increase is the magnitude of the gradient. Thus .  The gradient points in the northeast direction, so .  A unit vector in the north direction is , so the rate of change of increase of the temperature in that direction is         Suppose that you are climbing a hill whose shape is given by , and that you are at the point (30, 20, 300).

How can we find the absolute maximum and minimum of on a closed and bounded domain?      We learn in single-variable calculus that the derivative is a useful tool for finding the local maxima and minima of functions, and that these ideas may often be employed in applied settings. In particular, if a function , such as the one shown in Figure is everywhere differentiable, we know that the tangent line is horizontal at any point where has a local maximum or minimum. This, of course, means that the derivative is zero at any such point. Hence, one way that we seek extreme values of a given function is to first find where the derivative of the function is zero.   The graph of .    In multivariable calculus, we are often similarly interested in finding the greatest and\/or least value(s) that a function may achieve. Moreover, there are many applied settings in which a quantity of interest depends on several different variables. In the following preview activity, we begin to see how some key ideas in multivariable calculus can help us answer such questions by thinking about the geometry of the surface generated by a function of two variables.   Let be a differentiable function, and suppose that at the point , achieves a local maximum. That is, the value of is greater than the value of for all nearby . You might find it helpful to sketch a rough picture of a possible function that has this property.   If we consider the trace given by holding constant, then the single-variable function defined by must have a local maximum at . What does this say about the value of the partial derivative ?    In the same way, the trace given by holding constant has a local maximum at . What does this say about the value of the partial derivative ?    What may we now conclude about the gradient at the local maximum? How is this consistent with the statement increases most rapidly in the direction ?     How will the tangent plane to the surface appear at the point ?    By first computing the partial derivatives, find any points at which may have a local maximum.        Extrema and Critical Points  One of the important applications of single-variable calculus is the use of derivatives to identify local extremes of functions (that is, local maxima and local minima). Using the tools we have developed so far, we can naturally extend the concept of local maxima and minima to several-variable functions.    Let be a function of two variables and .   The function has a local maximum at a point provided that for all points near . In this situation we say that is a local maximum value .    The function has a local minimum at a point provided that for all points near . In this situation we say that is a local minimum value .    An absolute maximum point is a point for which for all points in the domain of . The value of at an absolute maximum point is the maximum value of .    An absolute minimum point is a point such that for all points in the domain of . The value of at an absolute minimum point is the minimum value of .       We use the term extremum point to refer to any point at which has a local maximum or minimum. In addition, the function value at an extremum is called an extremal value . Figure illustrates the graphs of two functions that have an absolute maximum and minimum, respectively, at the origin .   An absolute maximum and an absolute minimum       In single-variable calculus, we saw that the extrema of a continuous function always occur at critical points , values of where fails to be differentiable or where . Said differently, critical points provide the locations where extrema of a function may appear. Our work in Preview Activity suggests that something similar happens with two-variable functions.  Suppose that a continuous function has an extremum at . In this case, the trace has an extremum at , which means that is a critical value of . Therefore, either does not exist or . Similarly, either does not exist or . This implies that the extrema of a two-variable function occur at points that satisfy the following definition.    A critical point critical point  of a function is a point in the domain of at which and , or such that one of or fails to exist.    We can therefore find critical points of a function by computing partial derivatives and identifying any values of for which one of the partials doesn't exist or for which both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero. For the latter, note that we have to solve the system of equations    Find the critical points of each of the following functions. Then, using appropriate technology, plot the graphs of the surfaces near each critical point and compare the graph to your work.                        .        Classifying Critical Points: The Second Derivative Test  While the extrema of a continuous function always occur at critical points, it is important to note that not every critical point leads to an extremum. Recall, for instance, from single variable calculus. We know that is a critical point since , but is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum of .  A similar situation may arise in a multivariable setting. Consider the function defined by whose graph and contour plot are shown in Figure . Because , we see that the origin is a critical point. However, this critical point is neither a local maximum or minimum; the origin is a local minimum on the trace defined by , while the origin is a local maximum on the trace defined by . We call such a critical point a saddle point due to the shape of the graph near the critical point.   A saddle point.       As in single-variable calculus, we would like to have some sort of test to help us identify whether a critical point is a local maximum, local maximum, or neither.   Recall that the Second Derivative Test for single-variable functions states that if is a critical point of a function so that and if exists, then   if , is a local maximum,    if , is a local minimum, and    if , this test yields no information.     Our goal in this activity is to understand a similar test for classifying extreme values of functions of two variables. Consider the following three functions: You can verify that each function has a critical point at the origin . You should check this.  Three surfaces.          The graphs of these three functions are shown in Figure , with at left, in the middle, and at right. Use the graphs to decide if a function has a local maximum, local minimum, saddle point, or none of the above at the origin.    There is no single second derivative of a function of two variables, so we consider a quantity that combines the second order partial derivatives. Let . Calculate at the origin for each of the functions , , and . What difference do you notice between the values of when a function has a maximum or minimum value at the origin versus when a function has a saddle point at the origin?    Now consider the cases where . It is in these cases that a function has a local maximum or minimum at a point. What is necessary in these cases is to find a condition that will distinguish between a maximum and a minimum. In the cases where at the origin, evaluate . What value does have when has a local maximum value at the origin? When has a local minimum value at the origin? Explain why. (Hint: This should look very similar to the Second Derivative Test for functions of a single variable.) What would happen if we considered the values of instead?       Activity provides the basic ideas for the Second Derivative Test for functions of two variables.   The Second Derivative Test  Suppose is a critical point of the function for which and . Let be the quantity defined by    If and , then has a local maximum at .    If and , then has a local minimum at .    If , then has a saddle point at .    If , then this test yields no information about what happens at .     The quantity is called the discriminant discriminant of the function at .   To properly understand the origin of the Second Derivative Test, we could introduce a second-order directional derivative. If this second-order directional derivative were negative in every direction, for instance, we could guarantee that the critical point is a local maximum. A complete justification of the Second Derivative Test requires key ideas from linear algebra that are beyond the scope of this course, so instead of presenting a detailed explanation, we will accept this test as stated. In Activity , we apply the test to more complicated examples.   Find the critical points of the following functions and use the Second Derivative Test to classify the critical points.              .      As we learned in single-variable calculus, finding extremal values of functions can be particularly useful in applied settings. For instance, we can often use calculus to determine the least expensive way to construct something or to find the most efficient route between two locations. The same possibility holds in settings with two or more variables.   While the quantity of a product demanded by consumers is often a function of the price of the product, the demand for a product may also depend on the price of other products. For instance, the demand for blue jeans at Old Navy may be affected not only by the price of the jeans themselves, but also by the price of khakis.  Suppose we have two goods whose respective prices are and . The demand for these goods, and , depend on the prices as   The seller would like to set the prices and in order to maximize revenue. We will assume that the seller meets the full demand for each product. Thus, if we let be the revenue obtained by selling items of the first good at price per item and items of the second good at price per item, we have   We can then write the revenue as a function of just the two variables and by using Equations and , giving us   A graph of as a function of and is shown in Figure .   A revenue function.      Find all critical points of the revenue function, . (Hint: You should obtain a system of two equations in two unknowns which can be solved by elimination or substitution.)    Apply the Second Derivative Test to determine the type of any critical point(s).    Where should the seller set the prices and to maximize the revenue?       Optimization on a Restricted Domain  The Second Derivative Test helps us classify critical points of a function, but it does not tell us if the function actually has an absolute maximum or minimum at each such point. For single-variable functions, the Extreme Value Theorem told us that a continuous function on a closed interval always has both an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval, and that these absolute extremes must occur at either an endpoint or at a critical point. Thus, to find the absolute maximum and minimum, we determine the critical points in the interval and then evaluate the function at these critical points and at the endpoints of the interval. A similar approach works for functions of two variables.  For functions of two variables, closed and bounded regions play the role that closed intervals did for functions of a single variable. A closed region is a region that contains its boundary (the unit disk is closed, while its interior is not, for example), while a bounded region is one that does not stretch to infinity in any direction. Just as for functions of a single variable, continuous functions of several variables that are defined on closed, bounded regions must have absolute maxima and minima in those regions.   The Extreme Value Theorem  Let be a continuous function on a closed and bounded region . Then has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum in .   The absolute extremes must occur at either a critical point in the interior of or at a boundary point of . We therefore must test both possibilities, as we demonstrate in the following example.    Suppose the temperature at each point on the circular plate is given by   The domain is a closed and bounded region, as shown on the left of Figure , so the Extreme Value Theorem assures us that has an absolute maximum and minimum on the plate. The graph of over its domain is shown in Figure . We will find the hottest and coldest points on the plate.   Domain of the temperature and its graph.       If the absolute maximum or minimum occurs inside the disk, it will be at a critical point so we begin by looking for critical points inside the disk. To do this, notice that critical points are given by the conditions and . This means that there is one critical point of the function at the point , which lies inside the disk.  We now find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary of the disk, which is the circle of radius 1. As we have seen, the points on the unit circle can be parametrized as where . The temperature at a point on the circle is then described by   To find the hottest and coldest points on the boundary, we look for the critical points of this single-variable function on the interval . We have   This shows that we have critical points when or . This occurs when , , , and . Since we have and , the corresponding points are     when ,    when .      when ,    when .     These are the critical points of on the boundary and so this collection of points includes the hottest and coldest points on the boundary.  We now have a list of candidates for the hottest and coldest points: the critical point in the interior of the disk and the critical points on the boundary. We find the hottest and coldest points by evaluating the temperature at each of these points, and find that     ,    ,      ,    .      ,      So the maximum value of on the disk is , which occurs at the two points on the boundary, and the minimum value of on the disk is which occurs at the critical point in the interior of .    From this example, we see that we use the following procedure for determining the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed and bounded domain.   Step 1:  Find all critical points of the function in the interior of the domain.    Step 2:  Find all the critical points of the function on the boundary of the domain. Working on the boundary of the domain reduces this part of the problem to one or more single variable optimization problems. Note that there may be endpoints on portions of the boundary that need to be considered.    Step 3:  Evaluate the function at each of the points found in Steps 1 and 2.    Step 4:  The maximum value of the function is the largest value obtained in Step 3, and the minimum value of the function is the smallest value obtained in Step 3.      Let with triangular domain whose vertices are at , , and . The domain and a graph of on the domain appear in Figure .   The domain of and its graph.         Find all of the critical points of in .    Parameterize the horizontal leg of the triangular domain, and find the critical points of on that leg. (Hint: You may need to consider endpoints.)    Parameterize the vertical leg of the triangular domain, and find the critical points of on that leg. (Hint: You may need to consider endpoints.)    Parameterize the hypotenuse of the triangular domain, and find the critical points of on the hypotenuse. (Hint: You may need to consider endpoints.)    Find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values of on .       Summary    To find the extrema of a function , we first find the critical points, which are points where one of the partials of fails to exist, or where and .    The Second Derivative Test helps determine whether a critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point.    If is defined on a closed and bounded domain, we find the absolute maxima and minima by finding the critical points in the interior of the domain, finding the critical points on the boundary, and testing the value of at both sets of critical points.

List them lexicographically, that is in ascending order by -coordinates, and for equal -coordinates in ascending order by -coordinates (e.g., (1,1),(1,10), (2, -1), (2, 3) is a correct order)  In lexicographic order:   The critical point with the smallest and coordinates is .

Let in the region where .  Explain why must have a global minimum at some point in (note that is unbounded---how does this influence your explanation?). Then find the global minimum.  minimum =        is continuous in the region , but is not closed and bounded so a special analysis is required. Notice that tends to as tends farther and farther from the origin or tends toward any point on the or axis. This suggests that a minimum for , if it exists, can not be too far from the origin or too close to the axes. For example, if then , and if then . If then , and if then . Since , a global minimum for if it exists must be in the smaller region , . The region is closed and bounded and so have a minimum value at some point in , and since that value is at most 14, it is also a global minimum for all of . Since the region has no boundary, the minimum value must occur at a critical point of . At a critical point we have The only critical point is , at which achieves the minimum value         Each of the following functions has at most one critical point.

If a continuous function of a single variable has two critical numbers and at which has relative maximum values, then must have another critical number , because it is impossible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. The other critical point can be a saddle point (a pass between the mountains) or a local minimum (a true valley). (From Calculus in Vector Spaces by Lawrence J. Corwin and Robert H. Szczarb.) Consider the function defined by . (From Ira Rosenholz in the Problems Section of the Mathematics Magazine , Vol. 60 NO. 1, February 1987.) Show that has exactly two critical points, and that has relative maximum values at each of these critical points. Explain how this function illustrates that it really is possible to have two mountains without some sort of valley in between. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by to see graphically how this happens.    If a continuous function of a single variable has exactly one critical number with a relative maximum at that critical point, then the value of at that critical point is an absolute maximum. In this exercise we see that the same is not always true for functions of two variables. Let (from The Only Critical Point in Town Test by Ira Rosenholz and Lowell Smylie in the Mathematics Magazine , VOL 58 NO 3 May 1985.). Show that has exactly one critical point, has a relative maximum value at that critical point, but that has no absolute maximum value. Use appropriate technology to draw the surface defined by to see graphically how this happens.    A manufacturer wants to procure rectangular boxes to ship its product. The boxes must contain 20 cubic feet of space. To be durable enough to ensure the safety of the product, the material for the sides of the boxes will cost $0.10 per square foot, while the material for the top and bottom will cost $0.25 per square foot. In this activity we will help the manufacturer determine the box of minimal cost.   What quantities are constant in this problem? What are the variables in this problem? Provide appropriate variable labels. What, if any, restrictions are there on the variables?    Using your variables from (a), determine a formula for the total cost of a box.    Your formula in part (b) might be in terms of three variables. If so, find a relationship between the variables, and then use this relationship to write as a function of only two independent variables.    Find the dimensions that minimize the cost of a box. Be sure to verify that you have a minimum cost.       A rectangular box with length , width , and height is being built. The box is positioned so that one corner is stationed at the origin and the box lies in the first octant where , , and are all positive. There is an added constraint on how the box is constructed: it must fit underneath the plane with equation . In fact, we will assume that the corner of the box opposite the origin must actually lie on this plane. The basic problem is to find the maximum volume of the box.   Sketch the plane , as well as a picture of a potential box. Label everything appropriately.    Explain how you can use the fact that one corner of the box lies on the plane to write the volume of the box as a function of and only. Do so, and clearly show the formula you find for .    Find all critical points of . (Note that when finding the critical points, it is essential that you factor first to make the algebra easier.)    Without considering the current applied nature of the function , classify each critical point you found above as a local maximum, local minimum, or saddle point of .    Determine the maximum volume of the box, justifying your answer completely with an appropriate discussion of the critical points of the function.    Now suppose that we instead stipulated that, while the vertex of the box opposite the origin still had to lie on the plane, we were only going to permit the sides of the box, and , to have values in a specified range (given below). That is, we now want to find the maximum value of on the closed, bounded region Find the maximum volume of the box under this condition, justifying your answer fully.       The airlines place restrictions on luggage that can be carried onto planes.   A carry-on bag can weigh no more than 40 lbs.    The length plus width plus height of a bag cannot exceed 45 inches.    The bag must fit in an overhead bin.     Let , , and be the length, width, and height (in inches) of a carry on bag. In this problem we find the dimensions of the bag of largest volume, , that satisfies the second restriction. Assume that we use all 45 inches to get a maximum volume. (Note that this bag of maximum volume might not satisfy the third restriction.)   Write the volume as a function of just the two variables and .    Explain why the domain over which is defined is the triangular region with vertices (0,0), (45,0), and (0,45).    Find the critical points, if any, of in the interior of the region .    Find the maximum value of on the boundary of the region , and then determine the dimensions of a bag with maximum volume on the entire region . (Note that most carry-on bags sold today measure by by inches with a volume of cubic inches, so that the bags will fit into the overhead bins.)        According to The Song of Insects by G.W. Pierce (Harvard College Press, 1948) the sound of striped ground crickets chirping, in number of chirps per second, is related to the temperature. So the number of chirps per second could be a predictor of temperature. The data Pierce collected is shown in Table ., where is the (average) number of chirps per second and is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.  A scatterplot of the data would show that, while the relationship between and is not exactly linear, it looks to have a linear pattern. It could be that the relationship is really linear but experimental error causes the data to be slightly inaccurate. Or perhaps the data is not linear, but only approximately linear.    Crickets chirping.                                                                     If we want to use the data to make predications, then we need to fit a curve of some kind to the data. Since the cricket data appears roughly linear, we will fit a linear function of the form to the data. We will do this in such a way that we minimize the sums of the squares of the distances between the values of the data and the corresponding values of the line defined by . This type of fit is called a least squares approximation. If the data is represented by the points , , , , then the square of the distance between and is . So our goal is to minimize the sum of these squares, of minimize the function defined by    Calculate and .    Solve the system and to show that the critical point satisfies (Hint: Don't be daunted by these expressions, the system and is a system of two linear equations in the unknowns and . It might be easier to let , , , and and write your equations using these constants.)    Use the Second Derivative Test to explain why the critical point gives a local minimum. Can you then explain why the critical point gives an absolute minimum?    Use the formula from part (b) to find the values of and that give the line of best fit in the least squares sense to the cricket data. Draw your line on the scatter plot to convince yourself that you have a well-fitting line.      "

  "body": " Constrained Optimization: Lagrange Multipliers     What geometric condition enables us to optimize a function subject to a constraint given by , where is a constant?    How can we exploit this geometric condition to find the extreme values of a function subject to a constraint?      We previously considered how to find the extreme values of functions on both unrestricted domains and on closed, bounded domains. Other types of optimization problems involve maximizing or minimizing a quantity subject to an external constraint. In these cases the extreme values frequently won't occur at the points where the gradient is zero, but rather at other points that satisfy an important geometric condition. These problems are often called constrained optimization problems and can be solved with the method of Lagrange Multipliers, which we study in this section.   According to U.S. postal regulations, the girth plus the length of a parcel sent by mail may not exceed 108 inches, where by girth we mean the perimeter of the smallest end. Our goal is to find the largest possible volume of a rectangular parcel with a square end that can be sent by mail. (We solved this applied optimization problem in single variable Active Calculus , so it may look familiar. We take a different approach in this section, and this approach allows us to view most applied optimization problems from single variable calculus as constrained optimization problems, as well as provide us tools to solve a greater variety of optimization problems.) If we let be the length of the side of one square end of the package and the length of the package, then we want to maximize the volume of the box subject to the constraint that the girth ( ) plus the length ( ) is as large as possible, or . The equation is thus an external constraint on the variables.    The constraint equation involves the function that is given by Explain why the constraint is a contour of , and is therefore a two-dimensional curve.  Contours of and the constraint equation .        Figure shows the graph of the constraint equation along with a few contours of the volume function . Since our goal is to find the maximum value of subject to the constraint , we want to find the point on our constraint curve that intersects the contours of at which has its largest value.    Points and in Figure lie on a contour of and on the constraint equation . Explain why neither nor provides a maximum value of that satisfies the constraint.    Points and in Figure lie on a contour of and on the constraint equation . Explain why neither nor provides a maximum value of that satisfies the constraint.    Based on your responses to parts i. and ii., draw the contour of on which you believe will achieve a maximum value subject to the constraint . Explain why you drew the contour you did.      Recall that is a contour of the function , and that the gradient of a function is always orthogonal to its contours. With this in mind, how should and be related at the optimal point? Explain.       Constrained Optimization and Lagrange Multipliers  In Preview Activity , we considered an optimization problem where there is an external constraint on the variables, namely that the girth plus the length of the package cannot exceed 108 inches. We saw that we can create a function from the constraint, specifically . The constraint equation is then just a contour of , , where is a constant (in our case 108). Figure illustrates that the volume function is maximized, subject to the constraint , when the graph of is tangent to a contour of . Moreover, the value of on this contour is the sought maximum value.   Contours of and the constraint contour.    To find this point where the graph of the constraint is tangent to a contour of , recall that is perpendicular to the contours of and is perpendicular to the contour of . At such a point, the vectors and are parallel, and thus we need to determine the points where this occurs. Recall that two vectors are parallel if one is a nonzero scalar multiple of the other, so we therefore look for values of a parameter that make   The constant is called a Lagrange multiplier Lagrange multiplier .  To find the values of that satisfy for the volume function in Preview Activity , we calculate both and . Observe that and thus we need a value of so that   Equating components in the most recent equation and incorporating the original constraint, we have three equations in the three unknowns , , and . First, note that if , then equation shows that . From this, Equation tells us that . So the point is a point we need to consider. Next, provided that (from which it follows that by Equation ), we may divide both sides of Equation by the corresponding sides of to eliminate , and thus find that   Substituting into Equation gives us or   Thus we have and as another point to consider. So the points at which the gradients of and are parallel, and thus at which may have a maximum or minimum subject to the constraint, are and . By evaluating the function at these points, we see that we maximize the volume when the length of the square end of the box is 18 inches and the length is 36 inches, for a maximum volume of cubic inches. Since , we obtain a minimum value at this point.  We summarize the process of Lagrange multipliers as follows.   The method of Lagrange multipliers  The general technique for optimizing a function subject to a constraint is to solve the system and for , , and . We then evaluate the function at each point that results from a solution to the system in order to find the optimum values of subject to the constraint.    A cylindrical soda can holds about 355 cc of liquid. In this activity, we want to find the dimensions of such a can that will minimize the surface area. For the sake of simplicity, assume the can is a perfect cylinder.   What are the variables in this problem? Based on the context, what restriction(s), if any, are there on these variables?    What quantity do we want to optimize in this problem? What equation describes the constraint? (You need to decide which of these functions plays the role of and which plays the role of in our discussion of Lagrange multipliers.)    Find and the values of your variables that satisfy Equation in the context of this problem.    Determine the dimensions of the pop can that give the desired solution to this constrained optimization problem.      The method of Lagrange multipliers also works for functions of more than two variables.   Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the dimensions of the least expensive packing crate with a volume of 240 cubic feet when the material for the top costs $2 per square foot, the bottom is $3 per square foot and the sides are $1.50 per square foot.   The method of Lagrange multipliers also works for functions of three variables. That is, if we have a function that we want to optimize subject to a constraint , the optimal point lies on the level surface defined by the constraint . As we did in Preview Activity , we can argue that the optimal value occurs at the level surface that is tangent to . Thus, the gradients of and are parallel at this optimal point. So, just as in the two variable case, we can optimize subject to the constraint by finding all points that satisfy and .    Summary    The extrema of a function subject to a constraint occur at points for which the contour of is tangent to the curve that represents the constraint equation. This occurs when     We use the condition to generate a system of equations, together with the constraint , that may be solved for , , and . Once we have all the solutions, we evaluate at each of the points to determine the extrema.        Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and minimum values of subject to the constraint , if such values exist.  maximum =  minimum =  (For either value, enter DNE if there is no such value.)             and our equation of constraint is . To optimize with Lagrange multipliers we solve the following system of equations  and Solving for gives us which we can use to find in terms of : Using this relation in our equation of constraint, we can solve for : so and thus So, solving for , we have , and . Thus, the critical points are and . Since the constraint is closed and bounded, maximum and minimum values of subject to the constraint exist. Evaluating at the critical points, we find that the maximum value is and the minimum value is .        Use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum and minimum values of , subject to the constraint  maximum =  minimum =  (For either value, enter DNE if there is no such value.)             : From the first equation, we get either or . If , from the second equation we get , so . If instead , then from the second equation . We conclude that the critical points are , , and . All three critical points satisfy the constraint . The Lagrange conditions, , are: From the first equation, when , we divide by to get . Substituting into the second equation, we get Then using from the constraint, we have so . Factoring, we get , so or . From the constraint, we get when and for . If instead , so that we cannot divide by in the first Lagrange equation, then from the constraint, . Summarizing, the following points are either critical points or satisfy the Lagrange conditions: These are the candidates for global maximum or minimum points.

Minimum distance =  Note: If you need to find roots of a polynomial of degree , you may want to use a calculator of computer to do so numerically. Also be sure that you can give a geometric justification for your answer.        be a point on the paraboloid. The square of the distance from to the point is given by and so we wish to minimize subject to the constraint We look for solutions to the equations and :   and If , the first three equations would imply that , which does not satisfy the fourth equation and so . If collect terms in and in the first and second equations, respectively, we get and Note that we cannot have , or , and so can divide these two equation to solve for , getting . If we divide the first and third equations we got from the Lagrange multipliers method, we have so that We can then plug all of these into the last equation, the constraint. This gives Multiplying by and collecting terms, we have Let . Clearly , , and . Thus there must be roots lying between and , between and , and between and . We can locate these numerically using a calculator or computer program, to find Then, using the equations for and in terms of , we have the corresponding values of and , and therefore have three solutions to the Lagrange multiplier equations:  and The distances (squared) from the paraboloid are  and so that the minimum distance is .

What are two things the double integral of a function can tell us?      In single-variable calculus, recall that we approximated the area under the graph of a positive function on an interval by adding areas of rectangles whose heights are determined by the curve. The general process involved subdividing the interval into smaller subintervals, constructing rectangles on each of these smaller intervals to approximate the region under the curve on that subinterval, then summing the areas of these rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. We will extend this process in this section to its three-dimensional analogs, double Riemann sums and double integrals over rectangles.   In this activity we introduce the concept of a double Riemann sum.    Review the concept of the Riemann sum from single-variable calculus. Then, explain how we define the definite integral of a continuous function of a single variable on an interval . Include a sketch of a continuous function on an interval with appropriate labeling in order to illustrate your definition.    In our upcoming study of integral calculus for multivariable functions, we will first extend the idea of the single-variable definite integral to functions of two variables over rectangular domains. To do so, we will need to understand how to partition a rectangle into subrectangles. Let be rectangular domain (we can also represent this domain with the notation ), as pictured in Figure .  Rectangular domain with subrectangles.     To form a partition of the full rectangular region, , we will partition both intervals and ; in particular, we choose to partition the interval into three uniformly sized subintervals and the interval into two evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure . In the following questions, we discuss how to identify the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.    Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. What is the length of each subinterval for from 1 to 3?    Explicitly identify , , , and . On Figure or your own version of the diagram, label these endpoints.    Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. What is the length of each subinterval for from 1 to 2? Identify , , and and label these endpoints on Figure .    Let denote the subrectangle . Appropriately label each subrectangle in your drawing of Figure . How does the total number of subrectangles depend on the partitions of the intervals and ?    What is area of each subrectangle?         Double Riemann Sums over Rectangles  For the definite integral in single-variable calculus, we considered a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval . In multivariable calculus, we will eventually develop the idea of a definite integral over a closed, bounded region (such as the interior of a circle). We begin with a simpler situation by thinking only about rectangular domains, and will address more complicated domains in Section .  Let be a continuous function defined on a rectangular domain . As we saw in Preview Activity , the domain is a rectangle and we want to partition into subrectangles. We do this by partitioning each of the intervals and into subintervals and using those subintervals to create a partition of into subrectangles. In the first activity, we address the quantities and notations we will use in order to define double Riemann sums and double integrals.   Let be defined on the rectangular domain . Partition the interval into four uniformly sized subintervals and the interval into three evenly sized subintervals as shown in Figure . As we did in Preview Activity , we will need a method for identifying the endpoints of each subinterval and the resulting subrectangles.   Rectangular domain with subrectangles.      Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. Label these endpoints in Figure .    What is the length of each subinterval ? Your answer should be in terms of and .

Calculate the product Explain, geometrically, what this product represents.    For each and , choose a point in the subrectangle . Identify and correctly label these points in Figure . Explain what the product represents.    If we were to add all the values for each and , what does the resulting number approximate about the surface defined by on the domain ? (You don't actually need to add these values.)    Write a double sum using summation notation that expresses the arbitrary sum from part ( ).       Double Riemann Sums and Double Integrals  Now we use the process from the most recent activity to formally define double Riemann sums and double integrals.    Let be a continuous function on a rectangle . A double Riemann sum for over double Riemann sum is created as follows.   -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle into subrectangles with opposite vertices and for between and and between and . These rectangles all have equal area .    Choose a point in each rectangle . Then, a double Riemann sum for over is given by        If on the rectangle , we may ask to find the volume of the solid bounded above by over , as illustrated on the left of Figure . This volume is approximated by a Riemann sum, which sums the volumes of the rectangular boxes shown on the right of Figure .   The volume under a graph approximated by a Riemann Sum.       As we let the number of subrectangles increase without bound (in other words, as both and in a double Riemann sum go to infinity), as illustrated in Figure , the sum of the volumes of the rectangular boxes approaches the volume of the solid bounded above by over . The value of this limit, provided it exists, is the double integral.   Finding better approximations by using smaller subrectangles.         Let be a rectangular region in the -plane and a continuous function over . With terms defined as in a double Riemann sum, the double integral of over double integral definition is     Some textbooks use the notation for a double integral. You will see this in some of the WeBWorK problems.    Interpretation of Double Riemann Sums and Double integrals.  At the moment, there are two ways we can interpret the value of the double integral.   Suppose that assumes both positive and negatives values on the rectangle , as shown on the left of Figure . When constructing a Riemann sum, for each and , the product can be interpreted as a signed volume of a box with base area and signed height . Since can have negative values, this height could be negative. The sum can then be interpreted as a sum of signed volumes of boxes, with a negative sign attached to those boxes whose heights are below the -plane.  The integral measures signed volume.      We can then realize the double integral as a difference in volumes double integral difference in volumes : tells us the volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the rectangle minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the rectangle . This is shown on the right of Figure .    The average of the finitely many values that we take in a double Riemann sum is given by If we take the limit as and go to infinity, we obtain what we define as the average value double integral average value of over the region , which is connected to the value of the double integral. First, to view as a double Riemann sum, note that Thus, where denotes the area of the rectangle . Then, the average value of the function over , , is given by Therefore, the double integral of over divided by the area of gives us the average value of the function on . Finally, if on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the box with base that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .      Let and let .   Draw a picture of . Partition into 2 subintervals of equal length and the interval into two subintervals of equal length. Draw these partitions on your picture of and label the resulting subrectangles using the labeling scheme we established in the definition of a double Riemann sum.    For each and , let be the midpoint of the rectangle . Identify the coordinates of each . Draw these points on your picture of .    Calculate the Riemann sum using the partitions we have described. If we let be the midpoint of the rectangle for each and , then the resulting Riemann sum is called a midpoint sum .    Give two interpretations for the meaning of the sum you just calculated.       Let on the rectangular domain . Partition into 3 equal length subintervals and into 2 equal length subintervals. A table of values of at some points in is given in Table , and a graph of with the indicated partitions is shown in Figure .

We conclude this section with a list of properties of double integrals. Since similar properties are satisfied by single-variable integrals and the arguments for double integrals are essentially the same, we omit their justification.   Properties of Double Integrals  Let and be continuous functions on a rectangle , and let be a constant. Then    .     .    If on , then .        Summary    Let be a continuous function on a rectangle . The double Riemann sum for over is created as follows.   -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where .    -  These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle into subrectangles with opposite vertices and for between and and between and . These rectangles all have equal area .    -  Choose a point in each rectangle . Then a double Riemann sum for over is given by        With terms defined as in the Double Riemann Sum, the double integral of over is     Two interpretations of the double integral are:   -  The volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the rectangle minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the rectangle ;    -  Dividing the double integral of over by the area of gives us the average value of the function on . If on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the box with base that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .           Suppose and is the rectangle with vertices (0,0), (6,0), (6,4), (0,4). In each part, estimate using Riemann sums. For underestimates or overestimates, consistently use either the lower left-hand corner or the upper right-hand corner of each rectangle in a subdivision, as appropriate.  (a) Without subdividing ,  Underestimate =  Overestimate =  (b) By partitioning into four equal-sized rectangles.  Underestimate =  Overestimate =                             Consider the solid that lies above the square (in the -plane) , and below the elliptic paraboloid .  Estimate the volume by dividing into 9 equal squares and choosing the sample points to lie in the midpoints of each square.              Let be the rectangle with vertices , , , and and let .  (a) Find reasonable upper and lower bounds for without subdividing .  upper bound =  lower bound =  (b) Estimate three ways: by partitioning into four subrectangles and evaluating at its maximum and minimum values on each subrectangle, and then by considering the average of these (over and under) estimates.  overestimate:   underestimate:   average:                             (a) If we take the partition of consisting of just itself, we get Similarly, we get  (b) The estimates asked for are just the upper and lower sums. We partition into subrectangles of width 2 and height 2, where is the lower-left corner of . The subrectangles are then , , , and . Then we find the lower sum The minimum occurs at the lower-left corner of each rectangle, so Similarly, the upper sum is so The upper sum is an overestimate and the lower sum is an underestimate, so we can get a better estimate by averaging them to get .        Using Riemann sums with four subdivisions in each direction, find upper and lower bounds for the volume under the graph of above the rectangle with .  upper bound =  lower bound =             into subrectangles with the lines , , , , and and the lines , , , , and . Then we have 16 subrectangles, each of which we denote , where is the location of the lower-left corner of the subrectangle. We want to find a lower bound and an upper bound for the volume above each subrectangle. The lower bound for the volume of is because the area of is . The function increases with both and over the whole region . Thus, because the minimum on each subrectangle is at the corner closest to the origin. Similarly, So we have Since and , expanding this sum gives  Similarly, we can compute the upper sum:          Consider the solid that lies above the square (in the xy-plane) ,  and below the elliptic paraboloid .  (A) Estimate the volume by dividing R into 4 equal squares and choosing the sample points to lie in the lower left hand corners.  (B) Estimate the volume by dividing R into 4 equal squares and choosing the sample points to lie in the upper right hand corners..  (C) What is the average of the two answers from (A) and (B)?                        The figure below shows contours of on the region , with and .   Using , find an overestimate and an underestimate for .  Overestimate =  Underestimate =             in each square, assuming that the largest value may be one larger than the largest contour value seen (if the contour doesn't seem to cross a corner of the square), we have and similarly, for an underestimate,         The figure below shows the distribution of temperature, in degrees C, in a 5 meter by 5 meter heated room.   Using Riemann sums, estimate the average temperature in the room.  average temperature =        . We shall begin our sum as an upper estimate starting with the lower left corner of the room and continue across the bottom and moving upward using the highest temperature, , in each case. So the upper Riemann sum becomes  Thus, taking the maximum value for each region (and, where the temperatures are not bounded in the box, taking the largest value plus one), we have  In the same way, the lower Riemann sum is formed by taking the lowest temperature (and, where the temperatures are not bounded in the box, taking the largest value minus one), , in each case:  Thus, taking the minimum value for each region, we have  So, averaging the upper and lower sums we get: . To compute the average temperature, we divide by the area of the room, That is, approximately C.        Values of are given in the table below. Let be the rectangle . Find a Riemann sum which is a reasonable estimate for with and . Note that the values given in the table correspond to midpoints.

Find the values of Riemann sums which are reasonable over- and under-estimates for with and .  over-estimate:  under-estimate:             Then we can calculate the lower and upper sum by taking the smallest and largest values on each rectangle: so the lower sum is and the upper sum is          The temperature at any point on a metal plate in the plane is given by , where and are measured in inches and in degrees Celsius.

Determine the area of the rectangle .    Estimate the average temperature, , over the region .    Do you think your estimate in (c) is an over- or under-estimate of the true temperature? Why?       Let be a function of independent variables and that is increasing in both the positive and directions on a rectangular domain . For each of the following situations, determine if the double Riemann sum of over is an overestimate or underestimate of the double integral , or if it impossible to determine definitively. Provide justification for your responses.   The double Riemann sum of over where is evaluated at the lower left point of each subrectangle.

The wind chill, as frequently reported, is a measure of how cold it feels outside when the wind is blowing.

  "body": " Iterated Integrals     How do we evaluate a double integral over a rectangle as an iterated integral, and why does this process work?      Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function over a rectangle as where the different variables and notation are as described in Section . Thus is a limit of double Riemann sums, but while this definition tells us exactly what a double integral is, it is not very helpful for determining the value of a double integral. Fortunately, there is a way to view a double integral as an iterated integral iterated integral rectangular coordinates , which will make computations feasible in many cases.  The viewpoint of an iterated integral is closely connected to an important idea from single-variable calculus. When we studied solids of revolution, such as the one shown in Figure , we saw that in some circumstances we could slice the solid perpendicular to an axis and have each slice be approximately a circular disk. From there, we were able to find the volume of each disk, and then use an integral to add the volumes of the slices. In what follows, we are able to use single integrals to generalize this approach to handle even more general geometric shapes.   A solid of revolution.     Let on the rectangular domain .  As with partial derivatives, we may treat one of the variables in as constant and think of the resulting function as a function of a single variable. Now we investigate what happens if we integrate instead of differentiate.   Choose a fixed value of in the interior of .

What will be the meaning of the sum ?    Explain why will determine the exact value of the volume under the surface over the rectangle .        Iterated Integrals  The ideas that we explored in Preview Activity work more generally and lead to the idea of an iterated integral. Let be a continuous function on a rectangular domain , and let   The function determines the value of the cross sectional area (by area we mean signed area) in the direction for the fixed value of of the solid bounded between the surface defined by and the -plane.   Summing volumes of cross section slices.        The value of this cross sectional area is determined by the input in . Since is a function of , it follows that we can integrate with respect to . In doing so, we use a partition of and make an approximation to the integral given by where is any number in the subinterval . Each term in the sum represents an approximation of a fixed cross sectional slice of the surface in the direction with a fixed width of as illustrated in Figure . We add the signed volumes of these slices as shown in the frames in Figure to obtain an approximation of the total signed volume.  As we let the number of subintervals in the direction approach infinity, we can see that the Riemann sum approaches a limit and that limit is the sum of signed volumes bounded by the function on . Therefore, since is itself determined by an integral, we have   Hence, we can compute the double integral of over by first integrating with respect to on , then integrating the resulting function of with respect to on . The nested integral is called an iterated integral , and we see that each double integral may be represented by two single integrals.  We made a choice to integrate first with respect to . The same argument shows that we can also find the double integral as an iterated integral integrating with respect to first, or   The fact that integrating in either order results in the same value is known as Fubini's Theorem.   Fubini's Theorem  If is a continuous function on a rectangle , then    Fubini's theorem enables us to evaluate iterated integrals without resorting to the limit definition. Instead, working with one integral at a time, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus from single-variable calculus to find the exact value of each integral, starting with the inner integral.   Let on the rectangular domain .   Viewing as a fixed constant, use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the integral Note that you will be integrating with respect to , and holding constant. Your result should be a function of only.    Next, use your result from (a) along with the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to determine the value of .    What is the value of ?

Summary    We can evaluate the double integral over a rectangle as an iterated integral in one of two ways:   -   , or    -   .   This process works because each inner integral represents a cross-sectional (signed) area and the outer integral then sums all of the cross-sectional (signed) areas.

  "body": " Double Integrals over General Regions     How do we define a double integral over a non-rectangular region?    What general form does an iterated integral over a non-rectangular region have?      Recall that we defined the double integral of a continuous function over a rectangle as where the notation is as described in Section . Furthermore, we have seen that we can evaluate a double integral over as an iterated integral of either of the forms   It is natural to wonder how we might define and evaluate a double integral over a non-rectangular region; we explore one such example in the following preview activity.   A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional figure with four faces, each of which is a triangle. A picture of the tetrahedron with vertices , , , and is shown at left in Figure . If we place one vertex at the origin and let vectors , , and be determined by the edges of the tetrahedron that have one end at the origin, then a formula that tells us the volume of the tetrahedron is    Left: The tetrahedron . Right: Projecting onto the -plane.         Use the formula to find the volume of the tetrahedron .    Instead of memorizing or looking up the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron, we can use a double integral to calculate the volume of the tetrahedron . To see how, notice that the top face of the tetrahedron is the plane whose equation is Provided that we can use an iterated integral on a non-rectangular region, the volume of the tetrahedron will be given by an iterated integral of the form The issue that is new here is how we find the limits on the integrals; note that the outer integral's limits are in , while the inner ones are in , since we have chosen . To see the domain over which we need to integrate, think of standing way above the tetrahedron looking straight down on it, which means we are projecting the entire tetrahedron onto the -plane. The resulting domain is the triangular region shown at right in Figure . Explain why we can represent the triangular region with the inequalities (Hint: Consider the cross sectional slice shown at right in Figure .)    Explain why it makes sense to now write the volume integral in the form     Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the iterated integral and compare to your result from part (a). (As with iterated integrals over rectangular regions, start with the inner integral.)       Double Integrals over General Regions  So far, we have learned that a double integral over a rectangular region may be interpreted in one of two ways:    tells us the volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the rectangle minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the rectangle ;     , where is the area of tells us the average value of the function on . If on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the box with base that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .     As we saw in Preview Activity , a function may be considered over regions other than rectangular ones, and thus we want to understand how to set up and evaluate double integrals over non-rectangular regions. Note that if we can, then the two interpretations of the double integral noted above will naturally extend to solid regions with non-rectangular bases.  So, suppose is a continuous function on a closed, bounded domain . For example, consider as the circular domain shown at left in Figure .   Left: A non-rectangular domain. Right: Enclosing this domain in a rectangle.       We can enclose in a rectangular domain as shown at right in Figure and extend the function to be defined over in order to be able to use the definition of the double integral over a rectangle. We extend in such a way that its values at the points in that are not in contribute 0 to the value of the integral. In other words, define a function on as   We then say that the double integral of over double integral over a general region is the same as the double integral of over , and thus   In practice, we just ignore everything that is in but not in , since these regions contribute 0 to the value of the integral.  Just as with double integrals over rectangles, a double integral over a domain can be evaluated as an iterated integral. If the region can be described by the inequalities and , where and are functions of only , then   Alternatively, if the region is described by the inequalities and , where and are functions of only , we have   The structure of an iterated integral is of particular note:  In an iterated double integral:   the limits on the outer integral must be constants;    the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable that is, if the inner integral is with respect to , then its limits may only involve and constants, and vice versa.     We next consider a detailed example.    Let be defined on the triangle with vertices , , and as shown at left in Figure .   A triangular domain and slices in the and directions.        To evaluate , we must first describe the region in terms of the variables and . We take two approaches.   Approach 1: Integrate first with respect to .  In this case we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form and therefore we need to describe in terms of inequalities Since we are integrating with respect to first, the iterated integral has the form where is a cross sectional area in the direction. So we are slicing the domain perpendicular to the -axis and want to understand what a cross sectional area of the overall solid will look like. Several slices of the domain are shown in the middle image in Figure . On a slice with fixed value, the values are bounded below by 0 and above by the coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Thus, ; to find , we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of . The hypotenuse connects the points (0,0) and (2,3) and hence has equation . This gives the upper bound on as . The leftmost vertical cross section is at and the rightmost one is at , so we have and . Therefore, We evaluate the iterated integral by applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus first to the inner integral, and then to the outer one, and find that     Approach 2: Integrate first with respect to .  In this case, we choose to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral in the form and thus need to describe in terms of inequalities Since we are integrating with respect to first, the iterated integral has the form where is a cross sectional area of the solid in the direction. Several slices of the domain perpendicular to the -axis are shown at right in Figure . On a slice with fixed value, the values are bounded below by the coordinate on the hypotenuse of the right triangle and above by 2. So ; to find , we need to write the hypotenuse as a function of . Solving the earlier equation we have for the hypotenuse ( ) for gives us . This makes . The lowest horizontal cross section is at and the uppermost one is at , so we have and . Therefore, We evaluate the resulting iterated integral as before by twice applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and find that      We see, of course, that in the situation where can be described in two different ways, the order in which we choose to set up and evaluate the double integral doesn't matter, and the same value results in either case.    The meaning of a double integral over a non-rectangular region, , parallels the meaning over a rectangular region. In particular,    tells us the volume of the solids the graph of bounds above the -plane over the closed, bounded region minus the volume of the solids the graph of bounds below the -plane under the region ;     , where is the area of tells us the average value of the function on . If on , we can interpret this average value of on as the height of the solid with base and constant cross-sectional area that has the same volume as the volume of the surface defined by over .      Consider the double integral , where is the triangular region with vertices (0,0), (4,0), and (0,2).   Write the given integral as an iterated integral of the form . Draw a labeled picture of with relevant cross sections.    Write the given integral as an iterated integral of the form . Draw a labeled picture of with relevant cross sections.

Consider the iterated integral .   Sketch the region of integration, , for which     Determine the equivalent iterated integral that results from integrating in the opposite order ( , instead of ). That is, determine the limits of integration for which     Evaluate one of the two iterated integrals above. Explain what the value you obtained tells you.    Set up and evaluate a single definite integral to determine the exact area of , .    Determine the exact average value of over .       Consider the iterated integral .   Explain why we cannot find a simple antiderivative for with respect to , and thus are unable to evaluate in the indicated order using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.    Given that , sketch the region of integration, .    Rewrite the given iterated integral in the opposite order, using . (Hint: You may need more than one integral.)    Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to evaluate the iterated integral you developed in (c). Write one sentence to explain the meaning of the value you found.    What is the important lesson this activity offers regarding the order in which we set up an iterated integral?        Summary    For a double integral over a non-rectangular region , we enclose in a rectangle and then extend integrand to a function so that at all points in outside of and for all points in . We then define to be equal to .    In an iterated double integral, the limits on the outer integral must be constants while the limits on the inner integral must be constants or in terms of only the remaining variable. In other words, an iterated double integral has one of the following forms (which result in the same value): where and are functions of only and the region is described by the inequalities and or where and are functions of only and the region is described by the inequalities and .        Evaluate the double integral where is the triangular region with vertices .              Evaluate the double integral where is the triangular region with vertices .              Evaluate the integral by reversing the order of integration.                Decide, without calculation, if each of the integrals below are positive, negative, or zero. Let D be the region inside the unit circle centered at the origin. Let T, B, R, and L denote the regions enclosed by the top half, the bottom half, the right half, and the left half of unit circle, respectively.

  "body": " Applications of Double Integrals     If we have a mass density function for a lamina (thin plate), how does a double integral determine the mass of the lamina?    How may a double integral be used to find the area between two curves?    Given a mass density function on a lamina, how can we find the lamina's center of mass?    What is a joint probability density function? How do we determine the probability of an event if we know a probability density function?      So far, we have interpreted the double integral of a function over a domain in two different ways. First, tells us a difference of volumes the volume the surface defined by bounds above the -plane on minus the volume the surface bounds below the -plane on . In addition, determines the average value of on . In this section, we investigate several other applications of double integrals, using the integration process as seen in Preview Activity : we partition into small regions, approximate the desired quantity on each small region, then use the integral to sum these values exactly in the limit.  The following preview activity explores how a double integral can be used to determine the density of a thin plate with a mass density distribution. Recall that in single-variable calculus, we considered a similar problem and computed the mass of a one-dimensional rod with a mass-density distribution. There, as here, the key idea is that if density is constant, mass is the product of density and volume.   Suppose that we have a flat, thin object (called a lamina ) whose density varies across the object. We can think of the density on a lamina as a measure of mass per unit area. As an example, consider a circular plate of radius 1 cm centered at the origin whose density varies depending on the distance from its center so that the density in grams per square centimeter at point is    Suppose that we partition the plate into subrectangles , where and , of equal area , and select a point in for each and . What is the meaning of the quantity ?    State a double Riemann sum that provides an approximation of the mass of the plate.    Explain why the double integral tells us the exact mass of the plate.    Determine an iterated integral which, if evaluated, would give the exact mass of the plate. Do not actually evaluate the integral. (This integral is considerably easier to evaluate in polar coordinates, which we will learn more about in Section .)        Mass  Density is a measure of some quantity per unit area or volume. For example, we can measure the human population density of some region as the number of humans in that region divided by the area of that region. In physics, the mass density of an object is the mass of the object per unit area or volume. As suggested by Preview Activity , the following holds in general.   The mass of a lamina  If describes the density of a lamina defined by a planar region , then the mass double integral mass of lamina of is given by the double integral .    Let be a half-disk lamina of radius 3 in quadrants IV and I, centered at the origin as shown in Figure . Assume the density at point is given by . Find the exact mass of the lamina.   A half disk lamina.       Area  If we consider the situation where the mass-density distribution is constant, we can also see how a double integral may be used to determine the area of a region. Assuming that over a closed bounded region , where the units of are mass per unit of area, it follows that is the mass of the lamina. But since the density is constant, the numerical value of the integral is simply the area.  As the following activity demonstrates, we can also see this fact by considering a three-dimensional solid whose height is always 1.   Suppose we want to find the area of the bounded region between the curves   A picture of this region is shown in Figure .   The volume of a solid with constant height is given by the area of the base times the height. Hence, we may interpret the area of the region as the volume of a solid with base and of uniform height 1. That is, the area of is given by . Write an iterated integral whose value is . (Hint: Which order of integration might be more efficient? Why?)  The graphs of and .       Evaluate the iterated integral from (a). What does the result tell you?      We now formally state the conclusion from our earlier discussion and Activity .   The double integral and area  Given a closed, bounded region in the plane, the area of , denoted , is given by the double integral      Center of Mass  The center of mass of an object is a point at which the object will balance perfectly. For example, the center of mass of a circular disk of uniform density is located at its center. For any object, if we throw it through the air, it will spin around its center of mass and behave as if all the mass is located at the center of mass.  In order to understand the role that integrals play in determining the center of mass of an object with a nonuniform mass distribution, we start by finding the center of mass of a collection of distinct point-masses in the plane.  Let , , , be masses located in the plane. Think of these masses as connected by rigid rods of negligible weight from some central point . A picture with four masses is shown in Figure . Now imagine balancing this system by placing it on a thin pole at the point perpendicular to the plane containing the masses. Unless the masses are perfectly balanced, the system will fall off the pole. The point at which the system will balance perfectly is called the center of mass of the system. Our goal is to determine the center of mass of a system of discrete masses, then extend this to a continuous lamina.   A center of mass of four masses.    Each mass exerts a force (called a moment ) around the lines and that causes the system to tilt in the direction of the mass. These moments are dependent on the mass and the distance from the given line. Let be the location of mass , the location of mass , etc. In order to balance perfectly, the moments in the direction and in the direction must be in equilibrium. We determine these moments and solve the resulting system to find the equilibrium point at the center of mass.  The force that mass exerts to tilt the system from the line is where is the gravitational constant. Similarly, the force mass exerts to tilt the system from the line is   In general, the force that mass exerts to tilt the system from the line is   For the system to balance, we need the forces to sum to 0, so that   Solving for , we find that   A similar argument shows that   The value is called the total moment with respect to the -axis; is the total moment with respect to the -axis. Hence, the respective quotients of the moments to the total mass, , determines the center of mass of a point-mass system:   Now, suppose that rather than a point-mass system, we have a continuous lamina with a variable mass-density . We may estimate its center of mass by partitioning the lamina into subrectangles of equal area , and treating the resulting partitioned lamina as a point-mass system. In particular, we select a point in the th subrectangle, and observe that the quanity is density times area, so approximates the mass of the small portion of the lamina determined by the subrectangle .  We now treat as a point mass at the point . The coordinates of the center of mass of these point masses are thus given by   If we take the limit as and go to infinity, we obtain the exact center of mass of the continuous lamina.   The center of mass of a lamina  The coordinates of the center of mass of a lamina center of mass of a lamina  with density are given by    The center of mass of a lamina can then be thought of as a weighted average of all of the points in the lamina with the weights given by the density at each point. The centroid centroid of a lamina of a lamina is the just the average of all of the points in the lamina, or the center of mass if the density at each point is 1.  The numerators of and are called the respective moments moments about coordinate axes of the lamina about the coordinate axes. Thus, the moment of a lamina with density about the -axis is and the moment of about the -axis is   If is the mass of the lamina, it follows that the center of mass is .   In this activity we determine integrals that represent the center of mass of a lamina described by the triangular region bounded by the -axis and the lines and in the first quadrant if the density at point is . A picture of the lamina is shown in Figure .   The lamina bounded by the -axis and the lines and in the first quadrant.      Set up an iterated integral that represents the mass of the lamina.    Assume the mass of the lamina is 14. Set up two iterated integrals that represent the coordinates of the center of mass of the lamina.       Probability  Calculating probabilities is a very important application of integration in the physical, social, and life sciences. To understand the basics, consider the game of darts in which a player throws a dart at a board and tries to hit a particular target. Let us suppose that a dart board is in the form of a disk with radius 10 inches. If we assume that a player throws a dart at random, and is not aiming at any particular point, then it is equally probable that the dart will strike any single point on the board. For instance, the probability that the dart will strike a particular 1 square inch region is , or the ratio of the area of the desired target to the total area of (assuming that the dart thrower always hits the board itself at some point). Similarly, the probability that the dart strikes a point in the disk of radius 3 inches is given by the area of divided by the area of . In other words, the probability that the dart strikes the disk is   The integrand, , may be thought of as a distribution function , describing how the dart strikes are distributed across the board. In this case the distribution function is constant since we are assuming a uniform distribution, but we can easily envision situations where the distribution function varies. For example, if the player is fairly good and is aiming for the bulls eye (the center of ), then the distribution function could be skewed toward the center, say for some constant positive . If we assume that the player is consistent enough so that the dart always strikes the board, then the probability that the dart strikes the board somewhere is 1, and the distribution function will have to satisfy This makes , which you can check.    For such a function , the probability that the dart strikes in the disk of radius 1 would be   Indeed, the probability that the dart strikes in any region that lies within is given by   The preceding discussion highlights the general idea behind calculating probabilities. We assume we have a joint probability density function joint probability density function  , a function of two independent variables and defined on a domain that satisfies the conditions    for all and in ,    the probability that is between some values and while is between some values and is given by     The probability double integral probability that the point is in is 1, that is      Note that it is possible that could be an infinite region and the limits on the integral in Equation could be infinite. When we have such a probability density function , the probability that the point is in some region contained in the domain (the notation we use here is ) is determined by    A firm manufactures smoke detectors. Two components for the detectors come from different suppliers one in Michigan and one in Ohio. The company studies these components for their reliability and their data suggests that if is the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component from the Michigan supplier and the life span (in years) of a randomly chosen component from the Ohio supplier, then the joint probability density function might be given by    Theoretically, the components might last forever, so the domain of the function is the set of all such that and . To show that is a probability density function on we need to demonstrate that or that Use your knowledge of improper integrals to verify that is indeed a probability density function.    Assume that the smoke detector fails only if both of the supplied components fail. To determine the probability that a randomly selected detector will fail within one year, we will need to determine the probability that the life span of each component is between 0 and 1 years. Set up an appropriate iterated integral, and evaluate the integral to determine the probability.    What is the probability that a randomly chosen smoke detector will fail between years 3 and 7?    Suppose that the manufacturer determines that one of the components is more likely to fail than the other, and hence conjectures that the probability density function is instead What is the value of ?

  "body": " Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates     What are the polar coordinates of a point in two-space?    How do we convert between polar coordinates and rectangular coordinates?    What is the area element in polar coordinates?    How do we convert a double integral in rectangular coordinates to a double integral in polar coordinates?      While we have naturally defined double integrals in the rectangular coordinate system, starting with domains that are rectangular regions, there are many of these integrals that are difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate. For example, consider the domain that is the unit circle and . To integrate over , we would use the iterated integral   For this particular integral, regardless of the order of integration, we are unable to find an antiderivative of the integrand; in addition, even if we were able to find an antiderivative, the inner limits of integration involve relatively complicated functions.  It is useful, therefore, to be able to translate to other coordinate systems where the limits of integration and evaluation of the involved integrals is simpler. In this section we provide a quick discussion of one such system polar coordinates and then introduce and investigate their ramifications for double integrals. The rectangular coordinate system allows us to consider domains and graphs relative to a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternate coordinate system that allows us to consider domains less suited to rectangular coordinates, such as circles.   The coordinates of a point determine its location. In particular, the rectangular coordinates of a point are given by an ordered pair , where is the (signed) distance the point lies from the -axis to and is the (signed) distance the point lies from the -axis to . In polar coordinates, we locate the point by considering the distance the point lies from the origin, , and the angle the line segment from the origin to forms with the positive -axis.    Determine the rectangular coordinates of the following points:    The point that lies 1 unit from the origin on the positive -axis.    The point that lies 2 units from the origin and such that makes an angle of with the positive -axis.    The point that lies 3 units from the origin such that makes an angle of with the positive -axis.      Part (a) indicates that the two pieces of information completely determine the location of a point: either the traditional coordinates, or alternately, the distance from the point to the origin along with the angle that the line through the origin and the point makes with the positive -axis. We write to denote the point's location in its polar coordinate representation. Find polar coordinates for the points with the given rectangular coordinates.    ii. iii.        For each of the following points whose coordinates are given in polar form, determine the rectangular coordinates of the point.    ii. iii.           Polar Coordinates  The rectangular coordinate system is best suited for graphs and regions that are naturally considered over a rectangular grid. The polar coordinate system is an alternative that offers good options for functions and domains that have more circular characteristics. A point in rectangular coordinates that is described by an ordered pair , where is the displacement from to the -axis and is the displacement from to the -axis, as seen in Preview Activity , can also be described with polar coordinates polar coordinates  , where is the distance from to the origin and is the angle formed by the line segment and the positive -axis, as shown at left in Figure .   The polar coordinates of a point and the polar coordinate grid.       Trigonometry and the Pythagorean Theorem allow for straightforward conversion from rectangular to polar, and vice versa.   Converting between rectangular and polar coordinates     Converting from rectangular to polar.  If we are given the rectangular coordinates of a point , then the polar coordinates of satisfy     Converting from polar to rectangular.  If we are given the polar coordinates of a point , then the rectangular coordinates of satisfy        Note: The angle in the polar coordinates of a point is not unique. We could replace with and still be at the same terminal point. In addition, the sign of does not uniquely determine the quadrant in which lies, so we have to determine the value of from the location of the point. In other words, more care has to be paid when using polar coordinates than rectangular coordinates.  We can draw graphs of curves in polar coordinates in a similar way to how we do in rectangular coordinates. However, when plotting in polar coordinates, we use a grid that considers changes in angles and changes in distance from the origin. In particular, the angles and distances partition the plane into small wedges as shown at right in Figure .   Most polar graphing devices can plot curves in polar coordinates of the form . Use such a device to complete this activity.   Before plotting the polar curve (where can have any value), think about what shape it should have, in light of how is connected to and . Then use appropriate technology to draw the graph and test your intuition.    The equation does not define as a function of , so we can't graph this equation on many polar plotters. What do you think the graph of the polar curve looks like? Why?    Before plotting the polar curve , what do you think the graph looks like? Why? Use technology to plot the curve and compare your intuition.    What does the region defined by (where can have any value) look like? (Hint: Compare to your response from part (a).)    What does the region defined by and look like?    Consider the curve . For some values of we will have . In these situations, we plot the point as (in other words, when , we reflect the point through the origin). With that in mind, what do you think the graph of looks like? Plot this curve using technology and compare to your intuition.        Integrating in Polar Coordinates  Consider the double integral where is the unit disk. While we cannot directly evaluate this integral in rectangular coordinates, a change to polar coordinates will convert it to one we can easily evaluate.  We have seen how to evaluate a double integral as an iterated integral of the form in rectangular coordinates, because we know that in rectangular coordinates. To make the change to polar coordinates, we not only need to represent the variables and in polar coordinates, but we also must understand how to write the area element, , in polar coordinates. That is, we must determine how the area element can be written in terms of and in the context of polar coordinates. We address this question in the following activity.   Left: A polar rectangle. Right: An annulus.        Consider a polar rectangle , with between and and between and as shown at left in Figure . Let and . Let be the area of this region.    Explain why the area in polar coordinates is not .    Now find by the following steps:    Find the area of the annulus (the washer-like region) between and , as shown at right in Figure . This area will be in terms of and .    Observe that the region is only a portion of the annulus, so the area of is only a fraction of the area of the annulus. For instance, if were , then the resulting wedge would be of the entire annulus. In this more general context, using the wedge between the two noted angles, what fraction of the area of the annulus is the area ?    Write an expression for in terms of , , , and .    Finally, write the area in terms of , , , and , where each quantity appears only once in the expression. (Hint: Think about how to factor a difference of squares.)      As we take the limit as and go to 0, becomes , becomes , and becomes , the area element. Using your work in (iv), write in terms of , , and .     From the result of Activity , we see when we convert an integral from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we must not only convert and to being in terms of and , but we also have to change the area element to in polar coordinates. As we saw in Activity , the reason the additional factor of in the polar area element is due to the fact that in polar coordinates, the cross sectional area element increases as increases, while the cross sectional area element in rectangular coordinates is constant. So, given a double integral in rectangular coordinates, to write a corresponding iterated integral in polar coordinates, we replace with , with and with . Of course, we need to describe the region in polar coordinates as well. To summarize:   Double integrals in polar coordinates  The double integral in rectangular coordinates can be converted to a double integral in polar coordinates iterated integral polar coordinates as .     Let on the disk . We will evaluate .  In rectangular coordinates the double integral can be written as the iterated integral   We cannot evaluate this iterated integral, because does not have an elementary antiderivative with respect to either or . However, since and the region is circular, it is natural to wonder whether converting to polar coordinates will allow us to evaluate the new integral. To do so, we replace with , with , and with to obtain   The disc is described in polar coordinates by the constraints and . Therefore, it follows that   We can evaluate the resulting iterated polar integral as follows:     While there is no firm rule for when polar coordinates can or should be used, they are a natural alternative anytime the domain of integration may be expressed simply in polar form, and\/or when the integrand involves expressions such as    Let and .   Sketch the region and then write the double integral of over as an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates.    Write the double integral of over as an iterated integral in polar coordinates.    Evaluate one of the iterated integrals. Why is the final value you found not surprising?       Consider the circle given by as shown in Figure .  The graphs of and , for use in Activity .      Determine a polar curve in the form that traces out the circle . (Hint: Recall that a circle centered at the origin of radius can be described by the equations and .)    Find the exact average value of over the interior of the circle .    Find the volume under the surface over the region , where is the region bounded above by the line and below by the circle (this is the shaded region in Figure ).    Explain why in both (b) and (c) it is advantageous to use polar coordinates.        Summary    The polar representation of a point is the ordered pair where is the distance from the origin to and is the angle the ray through the origin and makes with the positive -axis.

  "body": " Surfaces Defined Parametrically and Surface Area     What is a parameterization of a surface?    How do we find the surface area of a parametrically defined surface?      We have now studied at length how curves in space can be defined parametrically by functions of the form , and surfaces can be represented by functions . In what follows, we will see how we can also define surfaces parametrically. A one-dimensional curve in space results from a vector function that relies upon one parameter, so a two-dimensional surface naturally involves the use of two parameters. If , , and are functions of independent parameters and , then the terminal points of all vectors of the form form a surface in space. The equations , , and are the parametric equations parameterization surface for the surface, or a parametrization of the surface. In Preview Activity we investigate how to parameterize a cylinder and a cone.   Recall the standard parameterization of the unit circle that is given by where .   Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in that has its center at and lies in the plane .    Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at and lies in the plane .    Determine a parameterization of the circle of radius 1 in 3-space that has its center at and lies in the plane .    Taking into account your responses in (a), (b), and (c), describe the graph that results from the set of parametric equations where and . Explain your thinking.    Just as a cylinder can be viewed as a stack of circles of constant radius, a cone can be viewed as a stack of circles with varying radius. Modify the parametrizations of the circles above in order to construct the parameterization of a cone whose vertex lies at the origin, whose base radius is 4, and whose height is 3, where the base of the cone lies in the plane . Use appropriate technology to plot the parametric equations you develop. (Hint: The cross sections parallel to the -plane are circles, with the radii varying linearly as increases.)        Parametric Surfaces  In a single-variable setting, any function may have its graph expressed parametrically. For instance, given , by considering the parameterization (where belongs to the domain of ), we generate the same curve. What is more important is that certain curves that are not functions may be represented parametrically; for instance, the circle (which cannot be represented by a single function) can be parameterized by , where .  In the same way, in a two-variable setting, the surface may be expressed parametrically by considering where varies over the entire domain of . Therefore, any familiar surface that we have studied so far can be generated as a parametric surface. But what is more powerful is that there are surfaces that cannot be generated by a single function (such as the unit sphere), but that can be represented parametrically. We now consider an important example.    Consider the torus (or doughnut) shown in Figure .   A torus.    To find a parametrization of this torus, we recall our work in Preview Activity . There, we saw that a circle of radius that has its center at the point and is contained in the horizontal plane , as shown in Figure , can be parametrized using the vector-valued function defined by where .   A circle in a horizontal plane centered at .    To obtain the torus in Figure , we begin with a circle of radius in the -plane centered at , as shown on the left of Figure . We may parametrize the points on this circle, using the parameter , by using the equations where .   Revolving a circle to obtain a torus.       Let's focus our attention on one point on this circle, such as the indicated point, which has coordinates for a fixed value of the parameter . When this point is revolved about the -axis, we obtain a circle contained in a horizontal plane centered at and having radius , as shown on the right of Figure . If we let be the new parameter that generates the circle for the rotation about the -axis, this circle may be parametrized by   Now using our earlier parametric equations for and for the original smaller circle, we have an overall parameterization of the torus given by   To trace out the entire torus, we require that the parameters vary through the values and .     In this activity, we seek a parametrization of the sphere of radius centered at the origin, as shown on the left in Figure . Notice that this sphere may be obtained by revolving a half-circle contained in the -plane about the -axis, as shown on the right.   A sphere obtained by revolving a half-circle.         Begin by writing a parametrization of this half-circle using the parameter : Be sure to state the domain of the parameter .    By revolving the points on this half-circle about the -axis, obtain a parametrization of the points on the sphere of radius . Be sure to include the domain of both parameters and . (Hint: What is the radius of the circle obtained when revolving a point on the half-circle around the axis?)    Draw the surface defined by your parameterization with appropriate technology.       The Surface Area of Parametrically Defined Surfaces  Recall that a differentiable function is locally linear that is, if we zoom in on the surface around a point, the surface looks like its tangent plane. We now exploit this idea in order to determine the surface area generated by a parametrization . The basic idea is a familiar one: we will subdivide the surface into small pieces, in the approximate shape of small parallelograms, and thus estimate the entire the surface area by adding the areas of these approximation parallelograms. Ultimately, we use an integral to sum these approximations and determine the exact surface area.  Let define a surface over a rectangular domain and . As a function of two variables, and , it is natural to consider the two partial derivatives of the vector-valued function , which we define by   In the usual way, we slice the domain into small rectangles. In particular, we partition the interval into subintervals of length and let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . Also partition the interval into subintervals of equal length and let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . These two partitions create a partition of the rectangle in -coordinates into sub-rectangles with opposite vertices and for between and and between and . These rectangles all have equal area .  Now we want to think about the small piece of area on the surface itself that lies above one of these small rectangles in the domain. Observe that if we increase by a small amount from the point in the domain, then changes by approximately . Similarly, if we increase by a small amount from the point , then changes by approximately . So we can approximate the surface defined by on the -rectangle with the parallelogram determined by the vectors and , as seen in Figure .   Approximation surface area with a parallelogram.    Say that the small parallelogram has area . If we can find its area, then all that remains is to sum the areas of all of the generated parallelograms and take a limit. Recall from our earlier work in the course that given two vectors and , the area of the parallelogram spanned by and is given by the magnitude of their cross product, . In the present context, it follows that the area, , of the parallelogram determined by the vectors and is where the latter equality holds from standard properties of the cross product and length.  We sum the surface area approximations from Equation over all sub-rectangles to obtain an estimate for the total surface area, , given by   Taking the limit as shows that the surface area of the surface defined by over the domain is given as follows.   Surface area  Let be a parameterization of a smooth surface over a domain . The area of the surface surface area defined by on is given by     Consider the cylinder with radius and height defined parametrically by for and , as shown in Figure .   A cylinder.      Set up an iterated integral to determine the surface area of this cylinder.    Evaluate the iterated integral.    Recall that one way to think about the surface area of a cylinder is to cut the cylinder horizontally and find the perimeter of the resulting cross sectional circle, then multiply by the height. Calculate the surface area of the given cylinder using this alternate approach, and compare your work in (b).     As we noted earlier, we can take any surface and generate a corresponding parameterization for the surface by writing . Hence, we can use our recent work with parametrically defined surfaces to find the surface area that is generated by a function over a given domain.   Let define a smooth surface, and consider the corresponding parameterization .   Let be a region in the domain of . Using Equation , show that the area, , of the surface defined by the graph of over is     Use the formula developed in (a) to calculate the area of the surface defined by over the rectangle .    Observe that the surface of the solid describe in (b) is half of a circular cylinder. Use the standard formula for the surface area of a cylinder to calculate the surface area in a different way, and compare your result from (b).        Summary    A parameterization of a curve describes the coordinates of a point on the curve in terms of a single parameter , while a parameterization of a surface describes the coordinates of points on the surface in terms of two independent parameters.    If describes a smooth surface in 3-space on a domain , then the area, , of that surface is given by         Consider the cone shown below.   If the height of the cone is 2 and the base radius is 3, write a parameterization of the cone in terms of and .   ,   , and   , with    and    .                                      and angle , we find , and in terms of the parameters and . We have  and with There are, of course, other parameterizations, but they will not be in terms of and , as required in this problem.        Parameterize the plane through the point with the normal vector    (Use and for the parameters in your parameterization, and enter your vector as a single vector, with angle brackets : e.g., as \\lt 1 + s + t, s - t, 3 - t \\gt .)        and that are parallel to the plane. Such vectors are perpendicular to the normal vector to the plane, . We can choose any vectors and such that . One choice is Letting , we have the parameterization         Parameterize a vase formed by rotating the curve , around the -axis. Use and for your parameters.   ,   , and   , with    and                                         , , around the -axis is shown in the figure below. At height , the cross-section is a horizontal circle of radius . Thus, letting the angle around the -axis be , a point on this horizontal circle is given by However, the radius and height are not independent. We can parameterize easily in two ways: first, suppose that we take the radius to be our second parameter, . Then, the height , and our parameterization is  and with Alternately, we could take the height to be the second parameter, . Then, solving for the radius in the expression for the curve, we get . Thus in this case the parameterization is  and with         Find parametric equations for the sphere centered at the origin and with radius 6. Use the parameters and in your answer.   ,   , and   , where    and    .                                      and as the two parameters. Since the radius is 6, we can take with         Find the surface area of that part of the plane that lies inside the elliptic cylinder  Surface Area =              Find the surface area of the part of the circular paraboloid that lies inside the cylinder .

The surface is the revolution surface obtained by revolving a curve extending vertically along one edge of the surface around the axis, as suggested by the figure below. From the measurements given, we obtain the equation of the curve Rotating this around the -axis, taking and as the parameters, we get the parametric equations  and with  (b) We know that the points in the curve consists of cross-sections of circles parallel to the plane and of radius . Thus, Integrating over , we get        Consider the ellipsoid given by the equation   In Activity , we found that a parameterization of the sphere of radius centered at the origin is for and .   Let be a point on the ellipsoid and let , , and . Show that lies on the sphere . Hence, find a parameterization of in terms of , , and as functions of and .    Use the result of part (a) to find a parameterization of the ellipse in terms of , , and as functions of and . Check your parametrization by substituting , , and into the equation of the ellipsoid. Then check your work by plotting the surface defined by your parameterization.       In this exercise, we explore how to use a parametrization and iterated integral to determine the surface area of a sphere.   Set up an iterated integral whose value is the portion of the surface area of a sphere of radius that lies in the first octant (see the parameterization you developed in Activity ).    Then, evaluate the integral to calculate the surface area of this portion of the sphere.    By what constant must you multiply the value determined in (b) in order to find the total surface area of the entire sphere.    Finally, compare your result to the standard formula for the surface area of sphere.       Consider the plane generated by over the region .   Sketch a picture of the overall solid generated by the plane over the given domain.    Determine a parameterization for the plane over the domain .

(Hint: Compare to the parameterization of a cylinder as seen in Activity .)    Set up an iterated integral to determine the surface area of this cone.    Evaluate the iterated integral to find a formula for the lateral surface area of a cone of height and base .       "

  "body": " Triple Integrals     How are a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral of a continuous function defined?    What are two things the triple integral of a function can tell us?      We have now learned that we define the double integral of a continuous function over a rectangle as a limit of a double Riemann sum, and that these ideas parallel the single-variable integral of a function on an interval . Moreover, this double integral has natural interpretations and applications, and can even be considered over non-rectangular regions, . For instance, given a continuous function over a region , the average value of , , is given by where is the area of . Likewise, if describes a mass density function on a lamina over , the mass, , of the lamina is given by   It is natural to wonder if it is possible to extend these ideas of double Riemann sums and double integrals for functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums and then triple integrals for functions of three variables. We begin investigating in Preview Activity .   Consider a solid piece of granite in the shape of a box , whose density varies from point to point. Let represent the mass density of the piece of granite at point in kilograms per cubic meter (so we are measuring , , and in meters). Our goal is to find the mass of this solid.  Recall that if the density was constant, we could find the mass by multiplying the density and volume; since the density varies from point to point, we will use the approach we did with two-variable lamina problems, and slice the solid into small pieces on which the density is roughly constant.  Partition the interval into 2 subintervals of equal length, the interval into 3 subintervals of equal length, and the interval into 2 subintervals of equal length. This partitions the box into sub-boxes as shown in Figure .   A partitioned three-dimensional domain.      Let be the endpoints of the subintervals of after partitioning. Draw a picture of Figure and label these endpoints on your drawing. Do likewise with and What is the length of each subinterval for from 1 to 2? the length of ? of ?    The partitions of the intervals , and partition the box into sub-boxes. How many sub-boxes are there? What is volume of each sub-box?    Let denote the sub-box . Say that we choose a point in the th sub-box for each possible combination of . What is the meaning of ? What physical quantity will approximate?    What final step(s) would it take to determine the exact mass of the piece of granite?       Triple Riemann Sums and Triple Integrals  Through the application of a mass density distribution over a three-dimensional solid, Preview Activity suggests that the generalization from double Riemann sums of functions of two variables to triple Riemann sums of functions of three variables is natural. In the same way, so is the generalization from double integrals to triple integrals. By simply adding a -coordinate to our earlier work, we can define both a triple Riemann sum and the corresponding triple integral.    Let be a continuous function on a box . The triple Riemann sum of over triple Riemann sum is created as follows.   Partition the interval into subintervals of equal length . Let , , , be the endpoints of these subintervals, where . Do likewise with the interval using subintervals of equal length to generate , and with the interval using subintervals of equal length to have .    Let be the sub-box of with opposite vertices and for between and , between and , and between 1 and . The volume of each is .    Let be a point in box for each , , and . The resulting triple Riemann sum for on is        If represents the mass density of the box , then, as we saw in Preview Activity , the triple Riemann sum approximates the total mass of the box . In order to find the exact mass of the box, we need to let the number of sub-boxes increase without bound (in other words, let , , and go to infinity); in this case, the finite sum of the mass approximations becomes the actual mass of the solid . More generally, we have the following definition of the triple integral.    With following notation defined as in a triple Riemann sum, the triple integral of over triple integral is     As we noted earlier, if represents the density of the solid at each point , then is the mass of . mass of a solid Even more importantly, for any continuous function over the solid , we can use a triple integral to determine the average value of over , . We note this generalization of our work with functions of two variables along with several others in the following important boxed information. Note that each of these quantities may actually be considered over a general domain in , not simply a box, .   The triple integral represents the volume of the solid volume of a solid .    The average value of the function over a solid domain average value over a solid is given by where is the volume of the solid .    The center of mass center of mass of a solid of the solid with density is , where and is the mass of the solid .     In the Cartesian coordinate system, the volume element is , and, as a consequence, a triple integral of a function over a box in Cartesian coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral of the form   If we want to evaluate a triple integral as an iterated integral over a solid that is not a box, then we need to describe the solid in terms of variable limits.     Set up and evaluate the triple integral of over the box .    Let be the solid cone bounded by and . A picture of is shown at right in Figure . Our goal in what follows is to set up an iterated integral of the form to represent the mass of in the setting where tells us the density of at the point . Our particular task is to find the limits on each of the three integrals.  Left: The cone. Right: Its projection.         If we think about slicing up the solid, we can consider slicing the domain of the solid's projection onto the -plane (just as we would slice a two-dimensional region in ), and then slice in the -direction as well. The projection of the solid onto the -plane is shown at left in Figure . If we decide to first slice the domain of the solid's projection perpendicular to the -axis, over what range of constant -values would we have to slice?    If we continue with slicing the domain, what are the limits on on a typical slice? How do these depend on ? What, therefore, are the limits on the middle integral?    Finally, now that we have thought about slicing up the two-dimensional domain that is the projection of the cone, what are the limits on in the innermost integral? Note that over any point in the plane, a vertical slice in the direction will involve a range of values from the cone itself to its flat top. In particular, observe that at least one of these limits is not constant but depends on and .    In conclusion, write an iterated integral of the form that represents the mass of the cone .         Note well: When setting up iterated integrals, the limits on a given variable can be only in terms of the remaining variables. In addition, there are multiple different ways we can choose to set up such an integral. For example, two possibilities for iterated integrals that represent a triple integral over a solid are              where , , , , , , , and are functions of the indicated variables. There are four other options beyond the two stated here, since the variables , , and can (theoretically) be arranged in any order. Of course, in many circumstances, an insightful choice of variable order will make it easier to set up an iterated integral, just as was the case when we worked with double integrals.    Find the mass of the tetrahedron in the first octant bounded by the coordinate planes and the plane if the density at point is given by . A picture of the solid tetrahedron is shown at left in Figure .   Left: The tetrahedron. Right: Its projection.       We find the mass, , of the tetrahedron by the triple integral where is the solid tetrahedron described above. In this example, we choose to integrate with respect to first for the innermost integral. The top of the tetrahedron is given by the equation solving for then yields   The bottom of the tetrahedron is the -plane, so the limits on in the iterated integral will be .  To find the bounds on and we project the tetrahedron onto the -plane; this corresponds to setting in the equation . The resulting relation between and is   The right image in Figure shows the projection of the tetrahedron onto the -plane.  If we choose to integrate with respect to for the middle integral in the iterated integral, then the lower limit on is the -axis and the upper limit is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Note that the hypotenuse joins the points and and so has equation . Thus, the bounds on are . Finally, the values run from 0 to 6, so the iterated integral that gives the mass of the tetrahedron is   Evaluating the triple integral gives us     Setting up limits on iterated integrals can require considerable geometric intuition. It is important to not only create carefully labeled figures, but also to think about how we wish to slice the solid. Further, note that when we say we will integrate first with respect to , by first we are referring to the innermost integral in the iterated integral. The next activity explores several different ways we might set up the integral in the preceding example.   There are several other ways we could have set up the integral to give the mass of the tetrahedron in Example .   How many different iterated integrals could be set up that are equal to the integral in Equation ?    Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to , then , then that is equivalent to the integral in Equation . Before you write down the integral, think about Figure , and draw an appropriate two-dimensional image of an important projection.    Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to , then , then that is equivalent to the integral in Equation . As in (b), think carefully about the geometry first.    Set up an iterated integral, integrating first with respect to , then , then that is equivalent to the integral in Equation .      Now that we have begun to understand how to set up iterated triple integrals, we can apply them to determine important quantities, such as those found in the next activity.   A solid is bounded below by the square , , and above by the surface . A picture of the solid is shown in Figure .   The solid bounded by the surface .      First, set up an iterated double integral to find the volume of the solid as a double integral of a solid under a surface. Then set up an iterated triple integral that gives the volume of the solid . You do not need to evaluate either integral. Compare the two approaches.    Set up (but do not evaluate) iterated integral expressions that will tell us the center of mass of , if the density at point is .    Set up (but do not evaluate) an iterated integral to find the average density on using the density function from part (b).    Use technology appropriately to evaluate the iterated integrals you determined in (a), (b), and (c); does the location you determined for the center of mass make sense?       Summary    Let be a continuous function on a box . The triple integral of over is defined as where the triple Riemann sum is defined in the usual way. The definition of the triple integral naturally extends to non-rectangular solid regions .    The triple integral can tell us   -  the volume of the solid if ,    -  the mass of the solid if represents the density of at the point .   Moreover, is the average value of over .

Note that the projection of this into the -plane is the triangular region below . The mass of the volume is then Integrating with respect to , so that Then, integrating with respect to , Expanding the these terms, we have         The moment of inertia of a solid body about an axis in 3-space relates the angular acceleration about this axis to torque (force twisting the body). The moments of inertia about the coordinate axes of a body of constant density and mass occupying a region of volume are defined to be  Use these definitions to find the moment of inertia about the -axis of the rectangular solid of mass given by , , .                        of the solid is . Thus for we have This is or Similarly,         Express the integral as an iterated integral in six different ways, where E is the solid bounded by and .  1.              2.              3.              4.              5.              6.                                                                                                                                                                                                         Calculate the volume under the elliptic paraboloid and over the rectangle .

What are the spherical coordinates of a point, and how are they related to Cartesian coordinates?    What is the volume element in spherical coordinates? How does this inform us about evaluating a triple integral as an iterated integral in spherical coordinates?      We have encountered two different coordinate systems in  the rectangular and polar coordinates systems and seen how in certain situations, polar coordinates form a convenient alternative. In a similar way, there are two additional natural coordinate systems in . Given that we are already familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system for , we next investigate the cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems (each of which builds upon polar coordinates in ). In what follows, we will see how to convert among the different coordinate systems, how to evaluate triple integrals using them, and some situations in which these other coordinate systems prove advantageous.   In the following questions, we investigate the two new coordinate systems that are the subject of this section: cylindrical and spherical coordinates. Our goal is to consider some examples of how to convert from rectangular coordinates to each of these systems, and vice versa. Triangles and trigonometry prove to be particularly important.   The cylindrical (left) and spherical (right) coordinates of a point.         The cylindrical coordinates of a point in are given by where and are the polar coordinates of the point and is the same coordinate as in Cartesian coordinates. An illustration is given at left in Figure .    Find cylindrical coordinates for the point whose Cartesian coordinates are . Draw a labeled picture illustrating all of the coordinates.    Find the Cartesian coordinates of the point whose cylindrical coordinates are . Draw a labeled picture illustrating all of the coordinates.      The spherical coordinates of a point in are (rho), , and (phi), where is the distance from the point to the origin, has the same interpretation it does in polar coordinates, and is the angle between the positive axis and the vector from the origin to the point, as illustrated at right in Figure . You should convince yourself that any point in can be represented in spherical coordinates with , , and .  For the following questions, consider the point whose Cartesian coordinates are .    What is the distance from to the origin? Your result is the value of in the spherical coordinates of .    Determine the point that is the projection of onto the -plane. Then, use this projection to find the value of in the polar coordinates of the projection of that lies in the plane. Your result is also the value of for the spherical coordinates of the point.

Use a well-chosen right triangle to find the value of , which is the final component in the spherical coordinates of . Draw a carefully labeled picture that clearly illustrates the values of , , and in this example, along with the original rectangular coordinates of .    Based on your responses to i., ii., and iii., if we are given the Cartesian coordinates of a point , how are the values of , , and in the spherical coordinates of determined by , , and ?         Cylindrical Coordinates  As we stated in Preview Activity , the cylindrical coordinates cylindrical coordinates of a point are , where and are the polar coordinates of the point , and is the same coordinate as in Cartesian coordinates. The general situation is illustrated Figure .  Since we already know how to convert between rectangular and polar coordinates in the plane, and the coordinate is identical in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, the conversion equations between the two systems in are essentially those we found for polar coordinates.   Converting between Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates     Converting from Cartesian to cylindrical.  If we are given the Cartesian coordinates of a point , then the cylindrical coordinates of satisfy     Converting from cylindrical to cartesian.  If we are given the cylindrical coordinates of a point , then the Cartesian coordinates of satisfy assuming .      Just as with rectangular coordinates, where we usually write as a function of and to plot the resulting surface, in cylindrical coordinates, we often express as a function of and . In the following activity, we explore several basic equations in cylindrical coordinates and the corresponding surface each generates.   In this activity, we graph some surfaces using cylindrical coordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should first think about what each graph should look like before you plot it using appropriate technology.   What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates with , , and ? How does this example suggest that we call these coordinates cylindrical coordinates ? How does your answer change if we restrict to ?    What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates with , , and ?    What familiar surface is described by the points in cylindrical coordinates with , , and ?    Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation , where and . What familiar surface results?    Plot the graph of the cylindrical equation for . What does this surface look like?      As the name and Activity suggests, cylindrical coordinates are useful for describing surfaces that are cylindrical in nature.    Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates  To evaluate a triple integral as an iterated integral in Cartesian coordinates, we use the fact that the volume element is equal to (which corresponds to the volume of a small box). To evaluate a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates, we similarly must understand the volume element in cylindrical coordinates.   A picture of a cylindrical box, is shown in Figure . Let , , and . We want to determine the volume of in terms of , , , , , and .   A cylindrical box.      Appropriately label , , and in Figure .    Let be the area of the projection of the box, , onto the -plane, which is shaded blue in Figure . Recall that we previously determined the area in polar coordinates in terms of , , and . In light of the fact that we know and that is the standard coordinate from Cartesian coordinates, what is the volume in cylindrical coordinates?      Activity demonstrates that the volume element in cylindrical coordinates is given by , and hence the following rule holds in general.   Triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates  Given a continuous function over a region in ,   The latter expression is an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates . iterated integral cylindrical coordinates    Of course, to complete the task of writing an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates, we need to determine the limits on the three integrals: , , and . In the following activity, we explore how to do this in several situations where cylindrical coordinates are natural and advantageous.   In this activity we work with triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates.   Let be the solid bounded above by the graph of and below by on the unit disk in the -plane.   The projection of the solid onto the -plane is a disk. Describe this disk using polar coordinates.    Now describe the surfaces bounding the solid using cylindrical coordinates.    Determine an iterated triple integral expression in cylindrical coordinates that gives the volume of . You do not need to evaluate this integral.       Suppose the density of the cone defined by , with , is given by . A picture of the cone is shown at left in Figure , and the projection of the cone onto the -plane in given at right in Figure . Set up an iterated integral in cylindrical coordinates that gives the mass of the cone. You do not need to evaluate this integral.  The cylindrical cone and its projection onto the -plane.

You do not need to evaluate this integral.  A solid bounded by the cones and .           Spherical Coordinates  As we saw in Preview Activity , the spherical coordinates spherical coordinates of a point in 3-space have the form , where is the distance from the point to the origin, has the same meaning as in polar coordinates, and is the angle between the positive axis and the vector from the origin to the point. The overall situation is illustrated at right in Figure .   Converting from spherical to Cartesian coordinates.    The example in Preview Activity and Figure suggest how to convert between Cartesian and spherical coordinates.   Coverting between Cartesian and spherical coordinates     Converting from Cartesian to spherical.  If we are given the Cartesian coordinates of a point , then the spherical coordinates of satisfy where in the latter two equations, we require and .    Converting from spherical to Cartesian.  If we are given the spherical coordinates of a point , then the Cartesian coordinates of satisfy       When it comes to thinking about particular surfaces in spherical coordinates, similar to our work with cylindrical and Cartesian coordinates, we usually write as a function of and ; this is a natural analog to polar coordinates, where we often think of our distance from the origin in the plane as being a function of . In spherical coordinates, we likewise often view as a function of and , thus viewing distance from the origin as a function of two key angles.  In the following activity, we explore several basic equations in spherical coordinates and the surfaces they generate.   In this activity, we graph some surfaces using spherical coordinates. To improve your intuition and test your understanding, you should first think about what each graph should look like before you plot it using appropriate technology.   What familiar surface is described by the points in spherical coordinates with , , and ? How does this particular example demonstrate the reason for the name of this coordinate system? What if we restrict to ?    What familiar surface is described by the points in spherical coordinates with , , and ?    What familiar shape is described by the points in spherical coordinates with , , and ?    Plot the graph of , for and . How does the resulting surface appear?      As the name and Activity indicate, spherical coordinates are particularly useful for describing surfaces that are spherical in nature; they are also convenient for working with certain conical surfaces.    Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates  As with rectangular and cylindrical coordinates, a triple integral in spherical coordinates can be evaluated as an iterated integral once we understand the volume element .   To find the volume element in spherical coordinates, we need to understand how to determine the volume of a spherical box of the form (with , (with ), and (with ). An illustration of such a box is given at left in Figure . This spherical box is a bit more complicated than the cylindrical box we encountered earlier. In this situation, it is easier to approximate the volume than to compute it directly. Here we can approximate the volume of this spherical box with the volume of a Cartesian box whose sides have the lengths of the sides of this spherical box. In other words, where denotes the length of the circular arc from to .   Left: A spherical box. Right: A spherical volume element.         What is the length in terms of ?    What is the length of the arc ? (Hint: The arc is an arc of a circle of radius , and arc length along a circle is the product of the angle measure (in radians) and the circle's radius.)    What is the length of the arc ? (Hint: The arc lies on a horizontal circle as illustrated at right in Figure . What is the radius of this circle?)    Use your work in (a), (b), and (c) to determine an approximation for in spherical coordinates.     Letting , , and go to 0, it follows from the final result in Activity that in spherical coordinates, and thus allows us to state the following general rule.   Triple integrals in spherical coordinates  Given a continuous function over a region in , the triple integral is converted to the integral in spherical coordinates.  The latter expression is an iterated integral in spherical coordinates iterated integral spherical coordinates .   Finally, in order to actually evaluate an iterated integral in spherical coordinates, we must of course determine the limits of integration in , , and . The process is similar to our earlier work in the other two coordinate systems.   We can use spherical coordinates to help us more easily understand some natural geometric objects.   Recall that the sphere of radius has spherical equation . Set up and evaluate an iterated integral in spherical coordinates to determine the volume of a sphere of radius .    Set up, but do not evaluate, an iterated integral expression in spherical coordinates whose value is the mass of the solid obtained by removing the cone from the sphere if the density at the point is . An illustration of the solid is shown in Figure .  The solid cut from the sphere by the cone .           Summary    The cylindrical coordinates of a point are where is the distance from the origin to the projection of onto the -plane, is the angle that the projection of onto the -plane makes with the positive -axis, and is the vertical distance from to the projection of onto the -plane. When has rectangular coordinates , it follows that its cylindrical coordinates are given by When has given cylindrical coordinates , its rectangular coordinates are     The volume element in cylindrical coordinates is . Hence, a triple integral can be evaluated as the iterated integral     The spherical coordinates of a point in 3-space are (rho), , and (phi), where is the distance from to the origin, is the angle that the projection of onto the -plane makes with the positive -axis, and is the angle between the positive axis and the vector from the origin to . When has Cartesian coordinates , the spherical coordinates are given by Given the point in spherical coordinates , its rectangular coordinates are     The volume element in spherical coordinates is . Thus, a triple integral can be evaluated as the iterated integral         What are the rectangular coordinates of the point whose cylindrical coordinates are  ?  x=  y=  z=                        What are the rectangular coordinates of the point whose spherical coordinates are  ?

Thus, in spherical coordintes, the integral becomes          Use cylindrical coordinates to evaluate the triple integral , where E is the solid bounded by the circular paraboloid and the -plane.

  "body": " Change of Variables     What is a change of variables?    What is the Jacobian, and how is it related to a change of variables?      In single variable calculus, we encountered the idea of a change of variable in a definite integral through the method of substitution. For example, given the definite integral we naturally consider the change of variable . From this substitution, it follows that , and since implies and implies , we have transformed the original integral in into a new integral in . In particular,   The latter integral, of course, is far easier to evaluate.  Through our work with polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates, we have already implicitly seen some of the issues that arise in using a change of variables with two or three variables present. In what follows, we seek to understand the general ideas behind any change of variables in a multiple integral.   Consider the double integral where is the upper half of the unit disk.      Write the double integral given in Equation as an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates.    Write the double integral given in Equation  as an iterated integral in polar coordinates.      When we write the double integral as an iterated integral in polar coordinates we make a change of variables, namely   We also then have to change to . This process also identifies a polar rectangle  with the original Cartesian rectangle, under the transformation A transformation is another name for function: here, the equations and define a function by so that is a function (transformation) from to . We view this transformation as mapping a version of the -plane where the axes are viewed as representing and (the -plane) to the familiar -plane. in Equation . The vertices of the polar rectangle are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded region in rectangular coordinates.  To work with a numerical example, let's now consider the polar rectangle given by , so that , , , and .    Use the transformation determined by the equations in to find the rectangular vertices that correspond to the polar vertices in the polar rectangle . In other words, by substituting appropriate values of and into the two equations in , find the values of the corresponding and coordinates for the vertices of the polar rectangle . Label the point that corresponds to the polar vertex as , the point corresponding to the polar vertex as , the point corresponding to the polar vertex as , and the point corresponding to the polar vertex as .    Draw a picture of the figure in rectangular coordinates that has the points , , , and as vertices. (Note carefully that because of the trigonometric functions in the transformation, this region will not look like a Cartesian rectangle.) What is the area of this region in rectangular coordinates? How does this area compare to the area of the original polar rectangle?         Change of Variables in Polar Coordinates  The general idea behind a change of variables is suggested by Preview Activity . There, we saw that in a change of variables from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, a polar rectangle gets mapped to a Cartesian rectangle under the transformation   The vertices of the polar rectangle are transformed into the vertices of a closed and bounded region in rectangular coordinates. If we view the standard coordinate system as having the horizontal axis represent and the vertical axis represent , then the polar rectangle appears to us at left in Figure . The image of the polar rectangle under the transformation given by is shown at right in Figure . We thus see that there is a correspondence between a simple region (a traditional, right-angled rectangle) and a more complicated region (a fraction of an annulus) under the function given by .   A rectangle and its image .    Furthermore, as Preview Activity suggests, it follows generally that for an original polar rectangle , the area of the transformed rectangle is given by . Therefore, as and go to 0 this area becomes the familiar area element in polar coordinates. When we proceed to working with other transformations for different changes in coordinates, we have to understand how the transformation affects area so that we may use the correct area element in the new system of variables.    General Change of Coordinates  We first focus on double integrals. As with single integrals, we may be able to simplify a double integral of the form by making a change of variables (that is, a substitution) of the form where and are functions of new variables and . This transformation introduces a correspondence between a problem in the -plane and one in the the -plane. The equations and convert and to and ; we call these formulas the change of variable formulas. To complete the change to the new variables, we need to understand the area element, , in this new system. The following activity helps to illustrate the idea.   Consider the change of variables   Let's see what happens to the rectangle in the -plane under this change of variable.   Draw a labeled picture of in the -plane.    Find the image of the -vertex in the -plane. Likewise, find the respective images of the other three vertices of the rectangle : , , and .    In the -plane, draw a labeled picture of the image, , of the original -rectangle . What appears to be the shape of the image, ?    To transform an integral with a change of variables, we need to determine the area element for image of the transformed rectangle. Note that is not exactly a parallelogram since the equations that define the transformation are not linear. But we can approximate the area of with the area of a parallelogram. How would we find the area of a parallelogram that approximates the area of the -figure ? (Hint: Remember what the cross product of two vectors tells us.)       Activity presents the general idea of how a change of variables works. We partition a rectangular domain in the system into subrectangles. Let be one of these subrectangles. Then we transform this into a region in the standard Cartesian coordinate system. The region is called the image of ; the region is the pre-image of . Although the sides of this region aren't necessarily straight (linear), we will approximate the element of area for this region with the area of the parallelogram whose sides are given by the vectors and , where is the vector from to , and is the vector from to .  An example of an image in the -plane that results from a transformation of a rectangle in the -plane is shown in Figure .   Approximating an area of an image resulting from a transformation.    The components of the vector are and similarly those for are   Slightly rewriting and , we have   For small and , the definition of the partial derivative tells us that   Recall that the area of the parallelogram with sides and is the length of the cross product of the two vectors, . From this, we observe that   Finally, by computing the magnitude of the cross product, we see that   Therefore, as the number of subdivisions increases without bound in each direction, and both go to zero, and we have   Equation hence determines the general change of variable formula in a double integral, and we can now say that   The quantity is called the Jacobian Jacobian , and we denote the Jacobian using the shorthand notation Recall from Section that we can also write this Jacobian as the determinant of the matrix . Note that, as discussed in Section , the absolute value of the determinant of is the area of the parallelogram determined by the vectors and , and so the area element in -coordinates is also represented by the area element in -coordinates, and is the factor by which the transformation magnifies area.  To summarize, the preceding change of variable formula that we have derived now follows.   Change of Variables in a Double Integral change of variable double integral  Suppose a change of variables and transforms a closed and bounded region in the -plane into a closed and bounded region in the -plane. Under modest conditions (that are studied in advanced calculus), it follows that     Find the Jacobian when changing from rectangular to polar coordinates. That is, for the transformation given by , , determine a simplified expression for the quantity   What do you observe about your result? How is this connected to our earlier work with double integrals in polar coordinates?    Let be the region in the -plane bounded by the lines , , and . We will evaluate the double integral with a change of variables.    Sketch the region in the -plane.    We would like to make a substitution that makes the integrand easier to antidifferentiate. Let and . Explain why this should make antidifferentiation easier by making the corresponding substitutions and writing the new integrand in terms of and .    Solve the equations and for and . (Doing so determines the standard form of the transformation, since we will have as a function of and , and as a function of and .)    To actually execute this change of variables, we need to know the -region that corresponds to the -region .    What equation corresponds to the equation ?    What equation corresponds to the equation ?    What equation corresponds to the equation ?    Sketch the region that corresponds to the domain .      Make the change of variables indicated by and in the double integral and set up an iterated integral in variables whose value is the original given double integral. Finally, evaluate the iterated integral.       Change of Variables in a Triple Integral  The argument for the change of variable formula for triple integrals is complicated, and we will not go into the details. The general process, though, is the same as the two-dimensional case. Given a solid in the -coordinate system in , a change of variables transformation , , and transforms into a region in -coordinates. Any function defined on can be considered as a function in -coordinates defined on . The volume element in -coordinates cooresponds to a scaled volume element in -coordinates, where the scale factor is given by the absolute value of the Jacobian, , which is the determinant of the matrix . (Recall that this determinant was introduced in Section .) That is, is given by   To summarize,  Change of Variables in a Triple Integral change of variable triple integral  Suppose a change of variables , , and transforms a closed and bounded region in -coordinates into a closed and bounded region in -coordinates. Under modest conditions (that are studied in advanced calculus), the triple integral is equal to      Find the Jacobian when changing from Cartesian to cylindrical coordinates. That is, for the transformation given by , , and , determine a simplified expression for the quantity   What do you observe about your result? How is this connected to our earlier work with triple integrals in cylindrial coordinates?    Consider the solid defined by the inequalities , , and . Consider the transformation defined by , , and . Let .   The transformation turns the solid in -coordinates into a box in -coordinates. Apply the transformation to the boundries of the solid to find -coordinatte descriptions of the box .    Find the Jacobian .    Use the transformation to perform a change of variables and evaluate by evaluating .        Summary    If an integral is described in terms of one set of variables, we may write that set of variables in terms of another set of the same number of variables. If the new variables are chosen appropriately, the transformed integral may be easier to evaluate.    The Jacobian is a scalar function that relates the area or volume element in one coordinate system to the corresponding element in a new system determined by a change of variables.        Find the absolute value of the Jacobian, , for the change of variables given by         Therefore,         Find the Jacobian. , where .          This determinant is computed the same way as for the cross product, with the entries in the first row playing the same role as . We get         Consider the transformation  A. Compute the Jacobian:    B. The transformation is linear, which implies that it transforms lines into lines. Thus, it transforms the square into a square with vertices:  T(37, 37) = ( , )  T(-37, 37) = ( , )  T(-37, -37) = ( , )  T(37, -37) = ( , )  C. Use the transformation to evaluate the integral                                                           Use the change of variables , to evaluate over the region in the first quadrant bounded by , , , and .          , the integrand and the region . Inverting the variable change gives , where we use the positive square root because the region is in the first quadrant where . Thus Therefore The integrand is . The region of integration can be transformed by examination of its boundaries. The left and right boundaries of are given by and . The bottom and top boundaries of given by and . Let be the rectangle , of area . We have         Use the change of variables , to find the area of the ellipse .  area =        where is the region . We must change variables in both the area element and the region . Inverting the variable change gives , . Thus Therefore The region of integration is Let be the unit disc . We have         Use the change of variables , to compute , where is the region bounded by .          we have Since So where is the region bounded by , , , . Then         Find positive numbers and so that the change of variables transforms the integral into for the region , the rectangle , and the region , the square .      What is in this case?                    is defined by the inequalities that correspond to the inequalities that define . Thus and . Then, we have and , so         Find a number so that the change of variables transforms the integral over the parallelogram in the -plane with vertices , , , into an integral over a rectangle in the -plane.   What is in this case?               , . The four edges of are The change of variables transforms the edges to These are equations for the edges of a rectangle in the -plane if the last two are of the form: . This happens when the terms drop out, or . With the change of variables gives over the rectangle The jacobian is         In this problem we use the change of variables , to compute the integral , where is the parallelogram with vertices , , , and .  First find the magnitude of the Jacobian,  .  Then, with  ,  ,   , and  ,        =                                                we have hence We therefore get  where is the region in the -plane corresponding to . Now, we need to find . Because we can use the boundaries of the region to find the boundaries of . Using the four vertices of the parallelogram , we the edges , , and . So, from the above transformation, the boundaries are , , and . Therefore (Alternately, we could of course also write the integral as .)       Let be the region in the -plane that is the parallelogram with vertices , , , and .   Sketch and label the region in the -plane.    Consider the integral . Explain why this integral would be difficult to set up as an iterated integral.    Let a change of variables be given by , . Using substitution or elimination, solve this system of equations for and in terms of and .    Use your work in (c) to find the pre-image, , which lies in the -plane, of the originally given region , which lies in the -plane. For instance, what point corresponds to in the -plane?    Use the change of variables in (c) and your other work to write a new iterated integral in and that is equivalent to the original integral .    Finally, evaluate the integral, and write a sentence to explain why the change of variables made the integration easier.       Consider the change of variables which is the transformation from spherical coordinates to rectangular coordinates. Determine the Jacobian of the transformation. How is the result connected to our earlier work with iterated integrals in spherical coordinates?    In this problem, our goal is to find the volume of the ellipsoid .   Set up an iterated integral in rectangular coordinates whose value is the volume of the ellipsoid. Do so by using symmetry and taking 8 times the volume of the ellipsoid in the first octant where , , and are all nonnegative.    Explain why it makes sense to use the substitution , , and in order to make the region of integration simpler.    Compute the Jacobian of the transformation given in (b).    Execute the given change of variables and set up the corresponding new iterated integral in , , and .    Explain why this new integral is better, but is still difficult to evaluate. What additional change of variables would make the resulting integral easier to evaluate?    Convert the integral from (d) to a new integral in spherical coordinates.    Finally, evaluate the iterated integral in (f) and hence determine the volume of the ellipsoid.       "

  "body": " Vector Fields     What is a vector field?    What are some familiar contexts in which vector fields arise?    How do we draw a vector field?    How do gradients of functions with partial derivatives connect to vector fields?      Vectors have played a central role in our study of multivariable calculus. We know how to do operations on vectors (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, etc.), and we have seen how vectors can be used to describe curves in and . The examples of using vectors to describe curves was our first example of a vector-valued function. In a curve is traced by the terminal point of , a function that has a real number as an input and produces a vector in or . In this section, we will expand our understanding of vector-valued functions to take a point in (or a point in ) as an input and produce a vector (typically in or , respectively) as output.    It's common when discussing weather to talk about the wind speed , but as any student who has gotten this far in the text will know, this nomenclature is imprecise. It's not terribly helpful to tell someone the wind is blowing at 10 without telling them the direction in which the wind is blowing. If you're trying to make a decision based on what the wind is doing, you need to know about the direction as well. For instance, if you are taking off in a hot air balloon, the wind direction will determine which direction the chase team should start going to keep track of you. Because of the swirling nature of wind, it makes sense to give the wind velocity at each point in a region (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).    Suppose that given a point in the plane, you know that the wind velocity at that point is given by the vector . For example, we'd then know that at the point , the wind velocity is . We will give the wind velocity as a function ,where . In the table below, fill in the wind velocity vectors for the given points.                                                  The vector field takes the coordinates of the point and reverses them to make the components of the vector. Thus, . The remaining vectors are shown in the table below.                           Suppose that we associate the vector to a point in the plane. Complete the table below by giving the vector associated to each of the given points.                                                                 Note that another way of writing is . Thus, , for example. The remaining answers are found in the table below.                                      A table of values of these vector-valued functions is useful to understand the input vs. output nature of a vector field as a function, but perhaps even better is a method of visualizing the vector outputs. A good picture is worth a thousand words (or numbers). Returning to our analogy of the output vector for our vector field being wind velocity, if , this means that at the location the wind is moving in the direction given by . Thus, we draw the output vector with its initial point at . Using the first set of axes in , plot the vectors for the five points in the table in part . The example is drawn for you.

Examples of Vector Fields  As showed, a velocity vector field is an example of a scenario where associating a vector to each point in a region is useful. We denote such a vector field by or , where the vector associated to the point or is the velocity of something at that point. Wind velocity is one example, but another example would be the velocity of a flowing fluid. shows such a velocity vector field. Technically, it only shows some of the vectors in the vector field, since the figure would be unintelligible if all of the vectors were shown. This is illustrated by the inset in the upper left corner, which gives a better picture of what we would see if we zoomed in on the red square of the main figure.

Green vectors representing the velocity vectors of a flowing fluid. The vectors along the vertical axis of syymmetry are directed from bottom to top and are longest in the middle. Vectors on either side of the vertical axis of symmetry form circular rotation patterns, clockwise on the right and counterclockwise on the left. In the upper left corner, there is an inset figure that enlarges the center of rotation on the left side of the image.    Force fields, such as those created by gravity, are also examples of vector fields. For example, the earth exerts a gravitational force on objects which is directed from the center of the object to the center of the earth. The magnitude of the force vector is determined by the distance between the object and the earth (by an reciprocal squared relationship.) An illustration of this vector field can be seen in , where the earth is positioned at the origin, but not shown. Notice that the vectors get shorter as the distance from the origin increases, reflecting the fact that the gravitational force is weaker at larger distances from the origin (Earth).   Gravitational vector field.       Mathematical Vector Fields  As suggested in the introduction and , vector fields can be specified using the notation of functions and vectors.    A vector field vectorfield definition in -space is function whose value at a point is a -dimensional vector . Similarly, in -space, a vector field is a function whose value at the point is a -dimensional vector.    Since is a vector, it has , , and components. Each of these components is a scalar function of the point , and so we will often write   For example, if , then the component functions of would be , , and . Any time we are considering a vector field , the definitions of functions , , and should be infered in this manner. (For a vector field in -space, we only have the functions and , defined analogously.)    Plotting Vector Fields   gave you a chance to plot some vectors in the vector fields and . It would be impossible to sketch all of the vectors in these vector fields, since there is one for every point in the plane. In fact, even sketching many more of the vectors than you were asked to in the preview activity rapidly becomes tedious. Fortunately, computers can do a great job of making such sketches. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the magnitudes of the vectors in computer plots are typically scaled, including plots of vector fields we will encounter later in this text. To illustrate this, consider the two plots of the vector field in .   Two plots of from Sage    A vector field in the plane with both axes ranging from to . Vectors point from the point to the point .    A vector field in the plane with both axes ranging from to . Vectors are shorter closer to the origin and longer farther away. At the left and right sides, the vectors follow arcs oriented clockwise. At the top and right sides, the vectors follow arcs oriented counterclockwise.     The left plot shows some of the vectors and accurately depicts all of their magnitudes, making the figure very hard to understand, especially along the lines and . The plot on the right, however, uses a uniform rescaling to make the figure easier to read. As before, each vector's direction is completely accurate, but now the magnitudes are much smaller. However, the relative magnitudes are preserved, helping us to see that vectors farther from the origin have larger magnitude than those closer to the origin.    The plot in illustrates the vector field .   The vector field   A vector field plotted in the plane with and both ranging from to . The vectors have a counterclockwise rotation about the origin, with vectors getting progressively longer as they get farther from the origin.     Starting with one of the vectors near the point , sketch a curve that follows the direction of the vector field . To help visualize what you are doing, it may be useful to think of the vector field as the velocity vector field for some flowing water and that you are imagining tracing the path that a tiny particle inserted into the water would follow as the water moved it around.     Repeat the previous step for at least two other starting points not on the curve you previously sketched.  Plots will be circles centered at the origin with radius given by the distance from the origin to the initial point.   What shape do the curves you sketched in the previous two steps form?  Plots will be circles centered at the origin with radius given by the distance from the origin to the initial point.   Verify that is orthogonal to .   =\\rangle the vectors are orthogonal   What is the relationship between the function and the vector ?   so meaning it is multiple of the gradient of the function.   What does this tell you about the relationship between and circles centered at the origin? What is the relationship between and the radius of the appropriate circle?  In other words, for any , the vector will point in the direction of greatest increase (or rate of change) of .    In the previous activity, we looked a special type of curve in a vector field, namely the curve that flows with the output of the vector field. Geometrically, the output vectors of the vector field will be tangent to the flow curves. These flow curves come up in several physical situations, including as solution curves to a system of differential equations. We will not discuss these applications here but you should should look out for uses of vector fields in the next few math courses.    Gradient Vector Fields  Without using the terminology, we've actually already encountered one very important family of vector fields a number of times. Given a function of two or three variables, the gradient of is a vector field, since for any point where has first-order partial derivatives, assigns a vector to that point (look at for a review).   In there are three sets of axes showing level curves for functions , , and , respectively. Sketch at least six vectors in the gradient vector field for each function. In making your sketches, you don't have to worry about getting vector magnitudes precise, but you should ensure that the relative magnitudes (and directions) are correct for each function independently.  Three sets of level curves      Eight skew ellipses centered at the origin. The major axis of the ellipses is the line . Labels on the ellipses range from to in increments of . The axes range approximately from to .       Seven equally-spaced lines with slope plotted on axes that range approximately from to . The lines are labeled from to increments of .       Axes ranging from to . In each quadrant, there are nested curves that appear like rounded squares far out and proceed toward circles in the middle. The curves are all labeled with either or .      The gradients need to be perpendicular to the curve at the points you choose.   Verify that is a gradient vector field by finding a function such that . For reasons originating in physics, such a function is called a potential function for the vector field .  We need to find the antiderivative: and . So .   Is the function found in part unique? That is, can you find another function such that but ?  The function found in (b) is not unique because C can be any value.   Is the vector field a gradient vector field? Why or why not?  We will consider that . So , then . And if then . Therefore, this is not a gradient vector field. (Otherwise ).      Summary     A -dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of whose value is a -dimensional vector. A -dimensional vector field is a function defined on part of whose value is a -dimensional vector.    A vector field is typically described in terms of its multivariable component functions, or in 3D .    Vector fields arise in familiar contexts such as wind velocity, fluid velocity, and gravitational force.    Vector fields are generally plotted in ways that ensure the direction and relative magnitudes of the vectors sketched are correct instead of ensuring that each vector's magnitude is depicted correctly.    The gradient of a function of two or three variables is a vector field defined wherever has partial derivatives.         Assume that for all of the vector fields in this question.

  "body": " The Idea of a Line Integral     What is an oriented curve and how can we represent one algebraically?    What is the meaning of the line integral of a vector-valued function along a curve and how can we estimate if its value is positive, negative, or zero?    What are important properties of the line integral of a vector-valued functions along a curve?      As we discussed in , vector fields are often used to represent forces such as gravity or electromagnetism, as well as the velocity of movement for things like wind or flowing water.  Velocity versus Force  Movement by things like air or water will exert a force on objects, so wind velocity vector fields are related to a force field but the relationship between a moving fluid and the force a fluid exerts on an object in the fuild can be complicated. Specifically, issues like drag\/friction and cross sectional area are a critical part of this relationship but are not something that we will focus on in our discussion. In the exploration below, we will look at a simplified version of this situation.  We learned in that the dot product of a force vector and a displacement vector tells us how much work the force did on the object as it moved from the start of its displacement vector to the end. However, this calculation assumes that the force is constant in the region of movement and that the object moves in a straight line along the displacement vector. The situation is more complicated than a dot product calculation when an object's movement is not in a straight line and when the force is not uniform throughout the area in which the object moves.  The preview activity uses cardinal directions to specify the direction of displacement vectors. These directions can be described by a compass rose. The compass rose given in is an example of a sixteen point rose. Note that directions like ESE are read as \"east-southeast\" since ESE is half way between east and southeast.   An example of a sixteen point compass rose (from By Brosen~commonswiki - Own work, CC BY 2.5)   A sixteen point compass rose      Recall from that the work done by a force on an object that moves with displacement vector is . In this Preview Activity, we consider the work done by wind on a helicopter at various stages of its journey.    Our intrepid pilot flies for some time and finds that they are 30 from where they started at a heading of 20 degrees east of due north. During this portion of the trip, the wind is exerting a force on the helicopter of 100 in the due east direction. Find the work the wind has done on the helicopter during the flight.     Will need to update solution here Here . The displacement vector of the helicopter is . Thus, the work done by the wind is .    Our pilot sees a storm ahead and changes thier direction. Some time later, the pilot determines that they are 25 due north of where they previously checked thier position. The wind is still exerting a force on the helicopter of 100  in the due east direction. Find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during the second part of the flight.     The displacement vector is . Thus, the work done by the wind is .    Find the helicopters's displacement from its original position after the first two parts of its flight and use that to find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during the first two parts of flight.   ;   The displacement is . The work done by the wind is thus .    How does your answer to connect to the answers to and ?   Sum.   It is the sum of the answers to the first two parts.    In order to get further away from the storm, the pilot turns and flies 45 west of due north for 50 . The storm the pilot was avoiding has caused the wind to change as well. For this portion of the flight, the wind is exerting a force on the helicopter of 125  in the south direction. Find the work done by the wind on the helicopter during this part of the flight.     The displacement vector is . The work is therefore .    Explain why you cannot take the total displacement of the three parts of the helicopter flight and calculate the total work done by the wind on the helicopter.     asdf      Orientations of Curves  Given our motivation for calculating the work that a force field does on an object as it moves through the field, it is natural to concern ourselves with how the object moves. In particular, in many circumstances it will be different if an object moves from the point to the point by first going up the -axis to and then moving horizontally to (illustrated by in ) than if the object moves along the line segment from directly to (illustrated by in ). Similarly, given a fixed force field, we would expect the work done to be different (in fact, opposite) if the object moves from to directly along a line segment ( in ). We say that a curve in or is oriented if we have specified the direction of travel along the curve. When a curve is given parametrically (including as a vector-valued function), our convention will be that the orientation follows from the smallest allowable value of the parameter to the largest.   Curves , , and demonstrating different paths and orientations between and   Three curves between (0,1) and (4,3)      For each curve below, find a parametrization of the curve. Ensure that each curve's orientation matches the one specified.    The line segment in from to .   for   The direction vector for the line segment is . The line segment starts at . Thus, the line segment given as the vector-valued function .    The line segment in from to .   for   The direction vector for the line segment is . The line segment starts at . Thus, the line segment given as the vector-valued function .    The circle of radius (in ) centered at the origin, beginning at the point and proceeding clockwise around the circle.   for   We can parametrize the circle in question in a clockwise direction as . To get the correct starting point, we require .    In , the portion of the parabola from the point to the point .   for   Here we can let and for .    In general, there are many ways to parametrize an oriented curve. With line segments, it is common to have the parameter range from to , although there are sometimes good reasons to choose another method. For circles and ellipses, you may find it useful to interchange the placement of and to change the orientation, but then careful attention will need to be paid to the start and end points. The interactive graph below allows you to plot parametric curves. You should experiment with the graph below and try to make sense of how different changes affects the graph below. Remember that you can change the highlighted point using the slider. You should take time now to at least try the following:  Change the upper bound of the plot to  Exchange the sine and cosine functions in and (but do not change the coefficents)  Change the in each of the component functions to  Change the to (you will need to use the exp(t) function in Sage)  Change the upper and lower bounds to get the same curve plotted as in the earlier parts     This is a plot of a parametric curve of the form . For two-dimensional curves, put 0 for . The interval of parameter values plotted is .       Line Integrals   showed how we can break up the work done along a path into a sum of work done on each piece. This will be a very helpful idea, especially if we consider the work done by a vector field that is not constant.  For example, let's consider who to measure the work done by , a vector field, along , the curve show below that goes from to .   A curve oriented from the point to the point with the plot of our vector field   An oriented curve from a point to a point    You can see that there will be parts of such that the dot product of the direction of travel and the vector field will be positive and some parts where the dot product is negative. We don't need to consider the output of the vector field except at the points on the curve. Thus, we will look at the following plot of the output of at a collection of points on the curve . Remember that when the vector field is plotted on the whole space, the lengths are rescaled to not be visually cluttered. In the actual output vectors are plotted for some points on .   A curve oriented from the point to the point with a vector field plotted at points along the curve   An oriented curve from a point to a point    Since the output of is changing as you move along the path, we will use a classically calculus argument as we did with other integration ideas and break our region up into smaller pieces to approximate the work done on each piece. below shows how we can break up into pieces, which we will call . Note that goes from the point to .   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces   An oriented curve from a point to a point    If we look at one of these smaller pieces (as show in ), we can see that vector field still changes at these points, but the output vectors are very similar. We can also see that the vector is a good approximation of the curve piece . Therefore we can approximate the work done by the vector field on the piece by , where is a point in .   A plot of the piece with the output of our vector field plotted at six poins on   An oriented curve from a point to a point    As we increase (the number of pieces of in our approximation) and make sure the length of each goes to zero, the vector field will be nearly constant on each piece and will be a better approximation of . This means that our approximation with pieces of would be and the exact amount of work done by over could be calculated by taking the limit of this approximation as the number of pieces increases and the size of each piece goes to zero. This should be a familiar Riemann sum argument from earlier definitions involving integration.   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces with the output of plotted at each intermediate point   An oriented curve from a point to a point       Let be an oriented curve and a vector field defined in a region containing . The line integral line integral definition of along is , provided the limit exists.    The limit in exists provided that is a continuous vector field, by which we mean that each component function of is continuous as a function of or variables, and that is a piecewise smooth curved traced out from its initial point to its terminal point without retracing any portion of the curve. Piecewise smooth means that the curve can be separated into parts which are individually smooth (can be parameterized with functions that are infinitely differentiable).  Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral can each be viewed as the work done by as an object moves along the (very small) vector , the line integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object that moves along (in the direction of its orientation).  If we are trying to determine how much a wind current helps or hinders an aircraft flying along a path determined by the curve, then calculating the dot product makes sense for the local amount of help or hindrance. Note here that our vector is the displacement from to . If the vector and the force field vector point in directions with an acute angle between them, the dot product will be positive. We are abusing notation here a tiny bit, since technically the domain of is points in or , and is a vector. By , we mean , where . On the other hand, if the angle between them is obtuse, the dot product will be negative and we also would note that the force field is hindering the aircraft's progress. This interpretation carries through with our limit argument above. Specifically, the line integral over a curve will be positive if more of the vector field is in the direction of travel than against the direction of travel. You will need to consider the value of the dot product and not just the sign when assessing whether a line integral will be positive\/neagtive\/zero.   Alternative notation for line integrals  Our notation for line integrals is one of several common notations. This notation's strength is that it emphasizes the role of a vector field and dot product. Another common notation for the line integral of a vector field along a curve is . This notation is common in physics and engineering. We will limit ourselves to the notation in the body of the text, but some exercises may use alternative notation.   Because the dot products in the definition of the line integral can each be viewed as the work done by as an object moves along the (very small) vector , the line integral gives the total work done by the vector field on an object that moves along (in the direction of its orientation).    Shown in are two vector fields, and and four oriented curves, as labeled in the plots. For each of the line integrals below, determine if its value should be positive, negative, or zero. Do this by thinking about if the vector field is helping or hindering a particle moving along the oriented curve, rather than by doing calculations.   Vector fields and oriented curves    A plot of with paths and   A vector field radiating from the origin with vectors getting longer as distance from the origin increases.

The top half of the circle of radius centered at the origin and oriented clockwise is labeled . There is an oriented line segment labeled from to .              The portion of that lies in the third quadrant is oriented in the opposite direction of the vector field. On the other hand, the portion of in the first quadrant is oriented in the same direction as . By symmetry, this forces .        Negative   The angle between the vectors of and are all obtuse. Thus, the line integral is negative.        Negative   The angle between the vectors of and are all obtuse (except for , where there is no angle), and thus the line integral is negative.        0   The vector field is always orthogonal to . Thus, the line integral is .    The next several sections will be devoted to determining ways to efficiently calculate line integrals. As with the limits in the definition of every other type of integral we've studied so far, the limit in the definition of the line integral is is cumbersome to work with in most cases. However, in the case where the oriented curve is composed of horizontal and vertical line segments, we can make a rather quick reduction to a single-variable integral, as the following example shows.    Consider the constant vector field . Let be the curve that follows the horizontal line segment from to and then continues down the vertical line segment to . shows and , including the orientation. Calculate    An oriented curve from to in a vector field .   The constant vector field as well as an oriented curve consisting of the line segment from to followed by the line segment from to .      To calculate , we start by working with the horizontal line segment. Along that part of , notice that . Thus, the Riemann sum that calculates the line integral along this portion of consists of terms of the form . Along this part of , ranges from to , and thus we can turn the Riemann sum here into the definite integral . Since the vectors are generally pointing in a direction that agrees with the orientation of , we are not surprised to have a positive value here.  Now we turn our attention to the vertical portion of . Here , which means that . Hence, our Riemann sum can be calculated by the definite integral . Notice that the limits of integration here were set up to match the orientation of . Also, the negative value should not be unexpected, since is oriented in a direction for which the vectors of point in a direction that would hinder motion along .  Combining these two calculations, we find that .      Properties of Line Integrals  In , we implicitly made use of the idea that if can be broken up into two curves and such that the terminal point of is the initial point of , then the line integral of along is the sum of the line integrals of along and along . Recalling the property for definite integrals that tells us if , then This ability to break line integrals into pieces (described below) is probably not surprising.   Convention for Describing Paths in Line Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of line integrals, we will establish some convenient notation. If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar analog amongst the properties of definite integrals.   Plots of , , , and                 Properties of Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , vector fields and , and oriented curves , , and , the following properties hold:                   .         shows a vector field as well as six oriented curves, as labeled in the plot.   A vector field and six oriented curves.   A vector field in the first quadrant with . Vectors are parallel to the -axis and point in the negative -direction. Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases. There are six labeled oriented curves. The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the line segment from to . The curve is the lower half of the circle of radius centered at oriented counterclockwise. The curve is the line segment from to .      Is positive, negative, or zero? Explain.   Negative   The portion of the vector field that produces acute angles with has smaller magnitude and smaller length than the portion that produces obtuse angles. Thus, the line integral must be negative.    Let . Determine if is positive, negative, or zero.   Negative   Notice that is orthogonal to and . Thus, . Where the magnitude of the vectors in is larger, points in the opposite direction as the orientation of . Thus, is negative.    Order the line integrals below from smallest to largest.      Notice that is the only one of the six line integrals that is positive, so it is the largest. Since is orthogonal to and , . Note that while is twice as long as , the vectors in the vector field that are hindering are more than twice as long as those hindering Thus, . We do not yet have all the tools necessary to calculate the exact value of . However, it is greater than . Thus, the ordering is .      The Circulation of a Vector Field  If an oriented curve ends at the same point where it started, we say that is closed . oriented curve closed The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation circulation of around . To emphasize the fact that is closed, we sometimes write for . Circulation serves as a measure of a vector field's tendency to rotate in a manner consistent with the orientation of the (closed) curve and is measured by looking at whether the vector field is working with or against the motion along the path.    Determine if the circulation of the vector field around each of the closed curves shown in is positive, negative, or zero.   Vector fields and closed curves    A vector field with vectors pointing along circles centered at the origin and in a clockwise direction. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases. Also shown is the circle of radius centered at the origin. The circle is oriented clockwise.    A vector field with all vectors parallel to the -axis. Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases. Vectors with point in the positive -direction, while vectors with point in the negative -direction. Also shown are two rectangles with sides parallel to the axes. One rectangle is oriented counterclockwise; its lower-left corner is at and its upper-right corner is at . The other rectangle is oriented clockwise; its lower-left corner is at and its upper-right corner is at .       Circular curve has positive circulation. Larger rectangular curve has positive circulation. Smaller rectangular curve has negative circulation.    The circular curve is oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The larger rectangular curve is either orthogonal to the vector field or oriented consistently with the vector field. Thus, the circulation is positive. The smaller rectangular curve is orthogonal to the vector field or has the opposite orientation. Thus, its circulation is negative.      Summary     An oriented curve can be represented by a vector-valued function of one variable where we interpret the initial and terminal values of the domain of as giving an orientation to the curve. A curve that ends at the same point where it started is said to be closed.    A line integral (of a vector field) measures the extent to which the vector field points in a direction consistent with the orientation of the curve.    Line integrals have many properties that are analogous to those of definite integrals of functions of a single variable.    The line integral of a vector field along a closed curve is called the circulation of the vector field along the curve.       Let be the path given below from to with pieces , , and as labeled. Let be a vector field such that , ,and .

How does the parametrization chosen for an oriented curve affect the value of the line integral ?    Under what conditions will changing the path taken from to change the the value of the line integral?       We begin this section by taking a look at how to calculate a line integral of a vector field along different line segments. We will use this calculation as inspiration to see how treating oriented curves as vector-valued functions will allow us to quickly turn a line integral of a vector field into a single variable integral.    Let , let be the line segment from to , let be the line segment from to , and let be the line segment from to . Also let . This vector field and the curves are shown in .   A vector field and three oriented curves   The vector field plotted for and . This vector field radiates from the origin with vector length increasing as distance from the origin increases. The graph includes the line segment from to , the line segment from to , and the line segment from to .      Every point along has . Therefore, along , the vector field can be viewed purely as a function of . In particular, along , we have . Since every point along has the same -value, write as a function of only (for the points on ).    along .    along .    Recall that , and along , we have that . Thus, . We know that along , .

Write as an integral of the form and evaluate the integral.   From the previous parts, .    Use an analogous approach to write as an integral of the form and evaluate the integral.     Along , and . Thus, we have .    Use the previous parts and a property of line integrals to calculate without having to evaluate any additional integrals.        In this activity, we will look at a process to write a line integral of a line segment as a definite integral in one variable. This uses the same set up as the Preview Activity including . In particular, evaluating takes more work at this stage, so let's break the process into a few steps.    Find the slope-intercept ( ) form of the equation of the line containing the line segment .   The slope is . Using this with either point gives , so the slope-intercept form of the line's equation is .    We now know how to express in terms of for all points along . Use this to express the components of in terms of only for the points along .   along .  We know that along , . Thus, along .    We often think of the slope of a line as being . Use this fact and the slope of the line containing the segment to express as a multiple of .   Since the line's slope is , we have , which implies that    We may view as . Since and , write as a vector in terms of . You should be able to factor out from your result and write your answer in the form .          Use the range of -values covered by the line segment to write as a single-variable integral of the form and evaluate the integral.       From the coordinates of its endpoints, we know that has . Combining the previous parts, we obtain .    Notice that and both start at and end at . How do the values of and compare?   Different values.   The results of the calculations for and are different.    Is a gradient vector field? Why or why not?   What would tell you about a potential function such that ?   No.   The vector field is not a gradient vector field because there is no scalar-valued function of two variables such that and . According to Clairaut's Theorem, if such a function existed, then , but .      Parametrizations in the Definition of   has shown us that it is possible to evaluate line integrals without needing to work with Riemann sums directly. However, the approaches taken there seem rather cumbersome to use for oriented curves that are not line segments. It was not critical that the paths in were straight lines, but rather that the paths had a description where both and could be expressed in terms of one variable. Fortunately, parametrizing the oriented curve along which a line integral is calculated provides exactly the tool we are looking for. Namely a parameterization gives a way to express the poinss of the oriented curve in terms of a single variable (the parameter). Note that given a parameterization, we can also translate the vector field component equations into functions of the parameter as well.   In this example, we will look at the particulars of applying a parameterization of (given by with ) to . In particular, we will use this parameterization and a set of points along that are equally spaced in terms of parameter values.  Suppose that is an oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function for , and let be a continuous vector field defined on a region containing . We can divide the interval into sub-intervals, each of length , by letting for . Dividing the interval into pieces using then can be used to break up into pieces by letting be the part of the curve from to for .   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces evenly spaced in terms of the paramter   An oriented curve from a point to a point    We can approximate the path with the displacement vector as we did in . Now notice that .   A curve oriented from the point to the point broken into pieces evenly spaced in terms of the paramter with displacement vectors   An oriented curve from a point to a point    Our vector field for can also be transformed into a function of by substituting the , , and inputs with the corresponding components of the parameterization. If , then the parameterization given by means we can rewrite as a function of .   We can now substitute these pieces into to get the following When evaluating the limit as , the expression in the parentheses will be . We then have a Riemann sum that changes the evaluation of a line integral of a vector field along an oriented curve to a definite integral of a function of one variable. In particular, Note that after evaluating the dot product, is (scalar) function of . This process will work with other ways of spliting the curve into different parts, but the algebra is more complex and not any more illuminating for understanding underlying ideas.     Let be a smooth, oriented curve traced out by the vector-valued function for . If is a continuous vector field defined near , then       Let and let be the quarter of the circle of radius from to . This vector field and curve are shown in . By properties of line integrals, we know that , and we will use this property since is the usual clockwise orientation of a circle, meaning we can parametrize by for .   The vector field and an oriented curve    The region in the -plane with and . The quarter circle of radius centered at the origin and oriented clockwise is shown along with the vector field , which contains vectors whose magnitudes increase more as increases than as increases. Also vectors farther from the -axis have steeper positive slope than those close to the -axis, which are close to horiznotal.    To evaluate using this parametrization, we need to note that   Thus, we have     As shows, allows us to reduce the problem of calculating a line integral of a vector-valued function along an oriented curve to one of finding a suitable parametrization for the curve. Once we have such a parametrization, evaluating the line integral becomes evaluating a single-variable integral, which is something you have done many times before. The example also illustrates that using the properties of line integrals can allow us to use a more natural parametrization. You may find it interesting to use the parametrization for to evaluate the line integral. Do you get the same result?    Find the work done by the vector field on a particle that moves from the point to the point along the helix given by .     for , so , so and   Let . Let be the closed curve consisting of the top half of the circle of radius centered at the origin and the portion of the -axis from to , oriented clockwise. Find the circulation of around .   Let be given by where . This means that and .  Let be given by where . This means that and .  Thus the line integral over then will give a result of .     will have you look at line integrals of the same vector field over several different types of curves. This will be an important, recurring theme as we study a variety of different integrals and vector fields in this chapter. In particular, we will use this approach of varying the region of integration for a fixed function several times in later activities.    Let .    Let be the portion of the graph of from to . Calculate .   If and the curve is traced out by for , then   Let be the line segment from to . Calculate .  In this part, the curve is traced out by for . So     Let be the circle of radius centered at the origin, oriented counterclockwise. Calculate .   In this part, the curve is traced out by as . So     To connect the previous parts of this activity, use a graphing utility to plot the curves and on the same axes.   What type of curve is ?   Closed   Since the curves have the same endpoints but is oriented oppositely, forms a closed curve.   What is the value of ?     Since , we have that .   What does your answer to part allow you to say about the value of the line integral of along the top half of compared to the line integral of from to along the bottom half of the circle of radius centered at the origin?  They are equal.  If we reverse the orientation of the bottom half, these curves combine to form . Thus, the sum of the two line integrals is , and so when changing the orientation of the bottom portion of the circle, we get that the line integrals are equal.      Alternative Notation for Line Integrals  In contexts where the fact that the quantity we are measuring via a line integral is best measured via a dot product (such as calculating work), the notation we have used thus far for line integrals is fairly common. However, sometimes the vector field is such that the units on , , and are not distances. In this case, a dot product may not have quite the same physical meaning, and an alternative notation using differentials can be common. Specifically, if , then . A line integral in the form of is called the differential form of a line integral line integral differential form of .  (If is a vector field in , the term is omitted.) For example, if and is some oriented curve in , then   It is important to recognize that the integral on the right-hand side is still a line integral and must be evaluated using techniques for evaluating line integrals. We cannot simply try to treat the line integral (of the form ) as if it were a definite integral of a function of one variable. Because the notation provides a reminder that this is a line integral and not a definite integral of the types calculated earlier in your study of calculus, we will only use the vector notation for line integrals in the body of the text. However, some exercises may require the use of the differential form.    Independence of Parametrization for a Fixed Curve  Up to this point, we have chosen whatever parametrization of an oriented curve was most convienent, and our argument for how we can use parametrizations to calculate line integrals did not depend on the specific choice of parametrization. However, it is not immediately obvious that different parametrizations don't result in different values of the line integral. Our next example explores this question.   Let . We consider two different oriented curves from to . The first oriented curve travels horiznotally to and then proceeds vertically to . The second oriented curve is the line segment from to . Notice that, as depicted in , we can break up into two oriented curves (the horiznotal portion) and (the vertical portion) so that .   The vector field and some oriented curves.   The vector field , which consists of horiznotal vectors that increase in length as distance from the -axis increases. Three oriented line segments are also depicted. The line segment is from to . The line segment is from to . The line segment is from to .     We first note that since is orthogonal to , ; therefore . We can parametrize as for ( is treated like the coordinate ), which leads to .  Thus, .  Now we look at , but we parametrize in a nonstandard way by letting for . (You should use a graphing utility to plot this parametrization to help convince yourself that it really does give .) This gives , and   I the next activity, you are asked to consider the more typical parametrization of and verify that using it gives the same value for the line integral.  It's also worth observing here that , so at least two (very different) paths from to give the same value of the line integral here. The next section will further investigate when line integrals over different paths (with the same initial point and final point) will evaluate to the same value.   As promised, the final activity of this section ( ) asks you to look at another parametrization of the curve from the previous example. It also asks you to look at two different oriented curves between a pair of points, similarly to what you did in .    The typical parametrization of the line segment from to (the oriented curve in ) is where . Use this parametrization to calculate for the vector field and compare your answer to the result of .   Using the parametrization given the line integral becomes This is the same result as in .    Calculate where is the oriented curve consisting of the line segment from the origin to followed by the line segment from to .   Let where and where . Our line integral can be computed with  Thus the line integral over then is     Calculate where is the line segment from to .   The line segment from to can be given by with . Note that , so     Is the vector field you considered in the previous two parts a gradient vector field? Why or why not? How does this compare to the vector field of ?  No  No. One way to observe this would be to check the partial derivative with respect to of the component and compare it to the partial derivative with respect to of the component. Since they are not equal, tells us that this vector field is not a gradient vector field.    Although we have not given a proof or even an intuitive argument, the phenomenon you observed in part of is not particular to this curve or this vector field. The value of does not depend on the parametrization of used to calculate the line integral when using .     Summary     Line integrals of vector fields along oriented curves can be evaluated by parametrizing the curve in terms of and then calculating the integral of on the interval .    The parametrization chosen for an oriented curve when calculating the line integral using the formula does not impact the value of the line integral.    If and are different paths from to , it is possible for to have a different value to .

(b) Using the parametrization in part (a), the line integral with respect to arc length is     with limits of integration  and   (c) Evaluate the line integral with respect to arc length in part (b).

The line segment can be given by as , which means that . Thus,    Compute when and is the line segment from to .     This is the same integral as the previous part with the orientation flipped, so     If the wind in a region of space is given by and a helicopter flies along the path given by as . Calculate the work done by the wind on the helicopter.   Set up your integral carefully and then use either integration by parts or an algebraic solver to compute the definite integral.

Path-Independent Vector Fields  We say that a vector field defined on a domain is path-independent pathindependent definition if whenever and are oriented paths in such that both curves start at the same point and end at point .  In and , we encountered situations where we had evidence that a vector field was path-independent. However, since the definition of path-independence requires that the value of the line integral be the same for every possible path from one point to the other (regardless of choice for the initial and final points), it doesn't appear that verifying a vector field is path-independent is an easy task.  Fortunately, one familiar class of vector fields can be shown to be path-independent. Let be a function for which is continuous on a domain . Suppose that and are points in and let be a smooth oriented path from to . Let's take a look at by fixing an arbitrary parametrization of , . Since we can write the , , and in terms of , the gradient of is given by: So we can write the line integral of the vector field over in the following way:   If , then the integrand above is Or more simply,   Notice that this is exactly what the chain rule tells us is equal to. Therefore, .  In other words, gradient vector fields are path-independent vector fields, and we can evaluate line integrals of gradient vector fields by using a potential function.   Technically the argument above assumed that was smooth, but we can replace by a piecewise smooth curve by splitting the line integral up into the sum of finitely many line integrals along smooth curves.   This result is so important that it is frequently called the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, because of its similarity to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which can be written as .   Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals   Let be a function for which is continuous on a domain . If and are points in and is a piece-wise smooth oriented path from to in , then .     Suppose we need to calculate the line integral of over the path from to along the curve given by . If we use to solve this, we would need to parameterize our curve, then take a derivative of the parameterization, then substitue into the line integral formula, then integrate the result.  In order to use , we first need to verify that there exists a potential function such that . You can use the techniques of to find that will be of the form . Note that , regardless of what value you choose for . By ,   If you changed the path in your line integral to be any other path between and , then the result would still be . If you changed the path in your line integral to be some path from to , then you would only need to evaluate . So for our new path ,      Calculate each of the following line integrals.     if and is the top half of the unit circle oriented from to .

By following the methodology laid out in to show that a given vector field is a gradient vector field, the makes evaluating some line integrals much simpler now.    Calculate each of the following line integrals.     if and is the line segment from to .  Find such that .

We can choose and note that . so by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Line Integrals, .     Line Integrals Along Closed Curves  Recall that an oriented curve is closed if the curve has the same initial and terminal point. A typical example of a closed curve would be a circle (with an orientation of which way to go around), but we could also consider something like the square with vertices , , , and , oriented clockwise (or counterclockwise). Recall that we sometimes use the symbol for a line integral when the curve is closed and that if , then .    Suppose that is a continuous path-independent vector field (in or ) on some domain .    Let and be points in and let and be oriented curves from to . What can you say about and ?  . Because is a path-independent vector field and both and start at and end at , .   Let . Explain why is a closed curve.   starts and ends at .   The curve is closed because the end of is the start of and the end of is the start of , thus starts and ends at .    Calculate .  and by part 1, this difference is zero.   Write a sentence that summarizes what we can conclude about line integrals of at this point in the activity.   The line integral along every closed curve in a path-independent vector field is .    Now let us suppose that is a continuous vector field on a domain for which for all closed curves . Pick two points and in . Let and be oriented curves from to . What type of curve is ?  Closed We have that is a closed curve (from to ) because will go from to and will go from back to .   What is ? Why?  We see that because (as stated above) is a continuous vector field on a domain for which for all closed curves .   What does that tell you about the relationship between and ?  Since , .   Explain why this shows that is path-independent.  Arbitrary paths with common initial and terminal points were used. The argument above relies only on the fact that the two paths have the same initial and terminal points.   We summarize the result of with the theorem below. Although this theorem is not a terribly useful way to show that a vector field is path-independent, it can be a useful way to show that a vector field is not path-independent: If you can find a closed curve around which the circulation is not zero, then the vector field is not path independent.    Let be a continuous vector field on a domain . Suppose that is a closed curve in . The circulation of along , given by , is zero if and only if is path-independent.    The following activity gives you a chance to reason about path-independence based purely on a graphical representation of a vector field.    Explain why neither of the vector fields in is path-independent.   Two vector fields that are not path-independent.      A vector field in which all vectors are horizontal. The vectors are along the -axis, point to the right for and point to the left for . Vectors get longer as distance from the -axis increases.       A vector field in which vectors appear to circulate in a clockwise manner around the point . The magnitude of vectors increases with the distance from . The plot shows the portion of the vector field with and .        For , consider a square with lower-left corner and upper-right corner . For , consider a circle centered at .    In , we consider the square with lower-left corner and upper-right corner , oriented clockwise, to be . Notice that because the line integrals along the horizontal edges of the square are both positive and the line integrals along the vertical sides are zero because is orthogonal to those sides. Because the line integral along this closed curve is not , is not path-independent.  In , consider the circle of radius centered at the point . It appears that is tangent to , but we can confidently say that along , which makes , and thus is not path-independent.      What other vector fields are path-independent?  Recall that in single variable calculus, the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that given a constant and a continuous function , there is a unique function for which and . In particular, is this function. We are about to investigate an analog of this result for path-independent vector fields, but first we require two additional definitions.  If is a subset of or , we say that is open  open definition provided that for every point in , there is a disc (in ) or ball (in ) centered at that point such that every point of the disc\/ball is contained in . For example, the set of points in for which is open, since we can always surround any point in this set by a tiny disc contained in the set (as illustrated by point in ). However, if we change the inequality to , then the set is not open, as any point on the circle cannot be surrounded by a disc contained in the set; any disc surrounding a point on that circle will contain points outside the set, that is with (as illustrated by the point in ). We will also say that a region is path-connected path-connected definition provided that for every pair of points in , there is a path from one to the other contained in .   The open set is plotted in yellow with a point on the boundary that shows why is not open   The open set is plotted in yellow with a point       Let be a continuous, path-independent vector field on an open, connected region . We will assume that is in and is a two-dimensional vector field, but the ideas below generalize completely to . We want to define a function on by using the vector field and line integrals, much like the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus allows us to define an antiderivative of a continuous function using a definite integral. To that end, we assign an arbitrary value. (Setting is probably convenient, but we won't explicitly tie our hands. Just assume that is defined to be some number.) Now for any other point in , define , where is any oriented path from to . Since is connected, such an oriented path must exist. Since is path-independent, is well-defined. If different paths from to gave different values for the line integral, then we'd not be sure what really is.  To better understand this mysterious function we've now defined, let's start looking at its partial derivatives.    Since is open, there is a disc (perhaps very small) surrounding that is contained in , so fix a point in that disc. Since is path-connected, there is a path from to . Let be the line segment from to and let be the line segment from to . (See Figure .) Rewrite as a sum of and line integrals along , , and .   Two piecewise smooth oriented curves from to .   Two oriented curves from to . Both begin with a curved arc from to . The curve on the left proceeds vertically from to and then horizontally to . The curve on the right proceeds horizontally from to and then vertically to .    Because , we have that .   Notice that we can parametrize by for . Find a similar parametrization for .   for The curve can be given by for , since only the -coordinate of points on varies.   Use the parametrization from above to write and as single variable integrals in the manner of . Use the fact that to express your integrals in terms of and without any dot products.   and   Using the parametrization of and from the previous part, we notice that has only one nonzero component in each case. Thus, we have and .    Rewrite your expression for using the single variable integrals above (and a line integral along ).      Combining the previous parts, we have .    Notice that your expression for from the previous part only depends on as the upper limit of an single variable integral. Use the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to calculate .   The first three terms in our expression for do not depend on , and thus when taking the partial derivative with respect to , they vanish. By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (treating as constants), . Therefore, .    To calculate , we continue to consider a path from to , but now let be the line segment from to and let be the line segment from to . Modify the process you used to find to find .   Proceeding as above, we find that . Only the last term of this expression depends on , so the first three terms vanish when calculating . By the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, . Therefore, .    What can you conclude about the relationship between and ? What does this tell you about beyond that it is path-independent and continuous?  ; is a gradient vector field  Since and , we can conclude that . Therefore, we know that is a gradient vector field.    We summarize the result of below.   Path-Independent Vector Fields   If is a path-independent vector field on an open, path-connected domain , then is a gradient vector field on . Furthermore, if is a point in and is fixed, then for a point in and an oriented curve from to in , the function is a potential function for .      Summary     Gradient vector fields are path-independent, and if is an oriented curve from to , then with the analogous result holding if is a function of three variables.    A vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is .    If a vector field is path-independent, then there exists a function such that . That is, is a conservative or gradient vector field.         Find the line integral with respect to arc length , where is the line segment in the -plane with endpoints and .

This means that any of the form (where is an integrable function of ) will make a gradient vector field.  Give a component function such that is not a gradient vector field.  Based on the and component functions of , the potential function will need to be of the form . This means that any that is not of the form (where is an integrable function of ) will prevent from being a conservative vector field.   This exercise focuses on reasoning graphically about line integrals and vector fields.   Find a closed curve on which the line integral of the vector field pictured below will not be zero.

How can you efficiently calculate the scalar line integral over a curve in space?      In , the idea of a line integral was introduced by looking at the work done by a vector field when traveling along , a path in space. In particular, the line integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is along the path (in the direction of travel.) shows how to use a Riemann sum to measure the accumulation of the vector field in the direction of travel along the given curve. Additionally, shows how the line integral can be efficently calculated in terms of the vector field and the derivative of any paramaterization of . Philosophically, the Riemann sum in is adding up the scalar function given by the dot product of the vector field and the unit vector in the direction of travel (along the curve).  We will devote the rest of this section to answering these questions about generalizing the ideas of line integrals as fully as possible.    How can we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a curve in space?  What would that accumulation measure physically?  What is the most efficent way to calculate this accumulation?      In order to pay for tutition, you take a job driving a mining machine that collects a very valuable mineral called Copium. Copium is only produced on the surface and is mined by scooping up the soil at the front of your machine, so the amoung of copium ore collected depends on the density of the ore and the distance driven by the mining machine. The plot of land you are mining has been surveyed for the density of copium ore and is presented in the contour plot below.   A plot of land with density of Copium deposits      Estimate the amount of Copium that would be mined from driving along the left side of plot.

Estimate the amount of copium that would be mined from the scraping the path given below (shown graphically in blue.) You should use at least 3 segments in your estimate. You should also explain how and why your answer to this question is different or similar to the previous task.   A plot of land with Copium Density and a path plotted in blue     multiplied the density by the length to get the amount   Write out a longer description?      Defining line integrals of scalar functions  In , you approximated the distance traveled for various paths and multiplied by the density of the Copium on each piece of the path. In contrast to the line integral of a vector field, the calculations of the ore mined does not depend on what direction the path was traveled. We will now use these same ideas to give precise meaning to the measurement of the acculumation of a scalar function's output over a path in space.  Let be a contiunuous function of , , and for some open set around , a curve from a point to a point . We will begin to approximate the acculumlation of the output of over by breaking into pieces with boundary points . The curve is the part of that goes from to and is the displacement vector from to    A curve in space with segments given by    We can approximate the accumulation of over with the following sum: where is the output of for some . As this sum uses more pieces and all of the lengths of the pieces goes to zero (i.e. ), we would expect that the sum will approach the actual acculumation of over . Notice that it won't matter how we select the point that is used in each piece to evaluate the output of since evaluating the limit as the length of gets smaller will ensure that the output value choosen will be within a shrinking error from the average value on each piece. Evaluating the limit of the sum above as the size of all of the pieces goes to zero will transform our Riemann sum into an integral that will measure the accumulation of the output of over .   The Line Integral of a Scalar Function  Let be a contiunuous function of , , and for some open set around , a curve from a point to a point in space. The line integral of over is defined as where are points such that and as the distance between and goes to zero.  The integral is called the scalar line integral of over the curve .   The notation for a scalar line integral ( ) may not immediately make sense. As with the other types of integration we have done (double integrals, line integrals of vector fields, single variable integration, etc.), the subscript of the integral symbol denotes the region of integration. In the case of a scalar line integral, the region of integration is a collection of points given by a curve in space. The function we are integrating is , a scalar-valued functiton of multiple variables. The differential probably looks suspicious to you. If you remember from , is the arc length of a curve in space. So the differential in the scalar line integral notation means that we are adding up the output of over steps in arc length. This should make sense in terms of how we set up our Riemann sums. We did not set up the pieces of our curve as steps in , , or , but rather as steps in arc length (estimated by ).    In this example we will make arguments about the line integral of the following scalar functions will be positive, negative, or zero. For all of this example, we will use the curve given by for .        The curve used in the line integral for     For our first case, we will consider the line integral . Remember that the line integral of over will measure the accumulation of the output of over the points on the curve . shows that the blue branch of the curve will have positive output and the red part will have negative output for . Intuitively, there is more of the curve with positive outputs than negative outputs, so we would expect to be positive.  The curve split into regions with positive (blue) and negative (red) outputs of   If we break our region into three pieces as shown in , we can make a rigourous argument about why the result of will be positive. We will call the red, green, and blue sections of  , , and respectively. So in the notation of , . No matter how we break up the curve to set up a Riemann sum used in we can do the symmetric version on curve . The only difference between the Riemann sums and thier associated line integrals for and will be the sign on the output of . This means that and thus   The curve split into three regions with positive (blue and green) and negative (red) outputs of   The argument for why requires that both the points on the curves and and the output of on those parts is symmetric. In you will see examples where having only one part of this symmetry is not sufficent to make this type of argument. We have shown that and want to demonstrate why will be positive. Because the output of is positive for all of the points on the curve , all elements of the associated Riemann sum in will be positive (the length of the displacement vectors and corresponding arc lengths are always positive). Thus . This argument would work well for any curve that was only in the first and second octants because the outpuf of for all of those points would be negative.  We now want to consider whether will be positive, negative, or zero. This is a simpler argument than in the previous case because the output of will be negative for all points in (execept for the origin). Each term in the Riemann sum used to define the scalar line integral will be the product of a negative value ( ) and a positive value ( ). Therefore the Riemann sums will be negative and the limit as you take more terms in this sum will also be negative. Thus, .  For our last case we want to make an argument whether will be positive, negative, or zero. While we cannot lean on the intuitive nature of the where coordinates are positive or negative, we can make a very precise argument about the output of for the points on . While will have a range that includes all real numbers, the output of is always zero for the points on our curve because for points on , the -coordinate is equal to the -coordinate squared. This means that no matter how we break up our segments for the Riemann sum, the terms will always be zero.

Using Parameterizations to Calculate Scalar Line Integrals   defined in terms of a limit of a Riemann sum which is usually very useful for understanding what is being measured and not very useful when it comes to efficiently calculating the value of a given integral. A scalar line integral is presented algebraically in terms of three variables because the curve is given in terms of points in three coordinates and the function to be integrated is dependent on those same coordinate values. Geometrically, the scalar line integral is a one dimensional problem because we only have one dimension to travel; namely we can travel along the curve (in steps of arc length). Remember that a parameterization of a curve in space is a description of how to travel through the , , and points of the curve in terms of a parameter (usually given as .) Parameterizations are very useful converting the three-variable algebra of a scalar line integral problem into a one dimensional integral.  Let's look at applying a parameterization for (given by a vector valued function of one variable for in some interval ) to . Instead of thinking in terms of pieces of the curve , the parameterization allows us to break the interval into pieces where and . While these pieces will be equally spaced in terms of the parameter , the corresponding points on the curve given by will not be equally spaced.   The curve split into segments defined by equally spaced parameter values    We can simplify the notation of our function evaluation as follows: where . Remember that the parameterization will allow us to write all parts of the scalar line integral as a function of , so we will simplify as follows: Applying our parameterization and corresponding points to Definition will give the following This is the Riemann Sum of a scalar function of , specifically where ( is the speed of the parameterization ).   Calculating Scalar Line Integrals with Parameterizations  Let be a continuous multivariable function for a region around , a curve in space parameterized by for .     Let us return to some of the problems from . Specifically, let be part of the unit circle on the -plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by . We will also consider . We can parameterize by with . Note here that . We can rewrite the output of along using the parameterization as . Applying , we get   This result should make sense from your earlier explainations of . Specifically, we can break the line integral of into three parts according to the following plot.   A subdivided plot of    The scalar line integal on the blue and the red paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric about -axis and the output of will be opposite in sign on the blue and red. This means that will be the same as the line integral of on the green path. Since the output of is positive on the green path, our result for the scalar line integral should be positive.    Let be part of the unit circle on the -plane that is centered at the origin and is above the line given by . We will also consider . We can parameterize by with . Note here that . We can write the output of along using the parameterization as . Applying , we get   This result should make sense from your earlier explainations of Task . Specifically, we can break the line integral of into three parts according to the following plot.   A subdivided plot of    The scalar line integal on the blue and the red paths will cancel each other out exactly since the paths are symmetric and the output of will be opposite in sign on the blue and red. Thus the line integral of over will be zero.     Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  Before stating some useful properties of scalar line integrals, we will recall some convenient notation from . If and are oriented curves, with from a point to a point and from to a point , we denote by the oriented curve from to that follows to and then continues along to . Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation. The list below summarizes some other properties of line integrals, each of which has a familiar in definite integrals.   Properties of Scalar Line Integrals  For a constant scalar , scalar valued functions and , and oriented curves , , and , the following properties hold:                         The biggest difference bewteen and is part c. The orientation of the curve does not change the value of the scalar line integral. will have you make sense of these rules for scalar line integrals.   Explaining Properties of Scalar Surface Integrals   In this activity, we will be explaining each of the Properties from in the context of our Copium mining analogy from . Remember that the curve in our scalar line integral cooresponds to the path the mining rig will take and the function in the scalar line integral measures the density of Copium at that point on the surface.    Explain in your own words what means in the Copium analogy and what exactly would be measured by this scalar line integral.

Visualizations of Scalar Line Integrals as Area Under a Curve  We will spend the last part of this section talking about a way to try to visualize the scalar line integral as an area under a curve (in the same way that we visualized 1D integrals.) Let's return to our Copium analogy from . In particular, we can look the left side of the mining area.   A plot of land with density of Copium deposits    In particular, we could visualize the linear density of Copium along the left side of the area using a plot like Figure .   A plot of the Copium density on the left side of the mine shown above    In , the horizontal axis gives the distance traveled along the left side of . Because this is a stright path, we could plot the density above the path of the Copium mining plot. In fact, we could plot the density above the plot for all of the sides of the mining plot.   A three-dimensional plot of the Copium Density plotted for the edges of the mining area     shows the Copium Mine plot (in gray) and the paths that are the boundary of the plot in red. The curve in green shows the Copium Density at each point on the boundary of the mine plot. The area in yellow would be the scalar line integral for the path that is the boundary of the mine plot. In particular, the area in yellow would give the total Copium mined from driving our mining machine around the boundary of the mine plot.  Because the curve we are looking at in involves straight lines and simple heights, there is no confusion when looking at this plot and using an area under the curve analogy. What if we looked at the scalar line integral of a function like along the helix given below?   A three-dimensional plot of a helix    You can already see part of the problem involved here since if we used the -coordinate to plot the output of our scalar function, then our area might intersect other parts of the curve. The plot below shows the confusing plot we would have if we looked at as the height above our curve in blue.   A three-dimensional plot of a helix with height given by      Summary     The scalar line integral, denoted by , measures the acculumation of the output of over the points on the curve .    Parameterizing the curve used in a scalar line integral allows you to compute the scalar line integral as a definite integral of 1-variable (the parameter).    Scalar line integrals can be split into pieces of the curve or along linear combinations of the scalar valued function being integrated.       Compute where and is the curve given by for .  Let be the path given below from to with pieces , , and as labeled. Let be a scalar-valued function such that , ,and .

Remember that the line integral of over will measure the accumulation of the output of over the points on the curve . shows that the blue branch of the curve will have positive output and the red part will have negative output for .

Because the output of is positive for all of the points on the curve , all elements of the associated Riemann sum in will be positive (the length of the displacement vectors and corresponding arc lengths are always positive). Thus . This argument would work well for any curve that was only in the first and second octants because the outpuf of for all of those points would be negative.  We now want to consider whether will be positive, negative, or zero. This is a simpler argument than in the previous case because the output of will be negative for all points in (execept for the origin). Each term in the Riemann sum used to define the scalar line integral will be the product of a negative value ( ) and a positive value ( ). Therefore the Riemann sums will be negative and the limit as you take more terms in this sum will also be negative. Thus, .  For our last case we want to make an argument whether will be positive, negative, or zero. While we cannot lean on the intuitive nature of the where coordinates are positive or negative, we can make a very precise argument about the output of for the points on .

  "title": "The Divergence of a Vector Field",
  "body": " The Divergence of a Vector Field     How can you measure where a vector field's strength is increasing or decreasing?    What does the divergence of a vector field measure and how can you visually estimate whether the divergence of a vector field is positive or negative?      As we saw in , there are many physical and theoretical representations for vector fields. A natural question is Where exactly is the vector field created? With the vector field in , imagine sketching a curve that follows the direction of the vector field by treating the vectors in the vector field as tangent vectors to your curve. No matter where you start, you should observe that the vector field decreases in strength as you move along the flow. We wish to understand (as a function of position), how much of the vector field is created (or destroyed) at a given location.   A vector field with changing strength   A vector field with vectors shortest along the line and longer as distance from that line increases. Vectors in the fourth quadrant point primarily in the positive -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the second quadrant point primarily in the negative -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the first and third quadrants exhibit a form of counterclockwise rotation.      In this preview activity, we will look at several two-dimensional vector fields and try to assess when the vector field has increased or decreased in strength over a given region. We begin with graphs of the three vector fields, , , and . Parts , , and ask you to answer the same three questions about the vector field and square illustrated in each of the figures. Part asks you to think further about the third vector field.   Vector Field   A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin. The length of vectors increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .     Vector Field   A vector field with vectors below the -axis pointing primarily up near the axis and primarily to the right farther away from the axis. Above the -axis, vectors point primarily to the right. Vector magnitudes are shortest near the positive -axis. There is a square in the second quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled , which appears to lie on the line .     Vector Field   A vector field in which vectors circulate around the origin as if tangent vectors to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases. There is a square in the first quadrant with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Centered in the square is a point labeled . There is a point labeled in the second quadrant that is the reflection of across the -axis. In the third quadrant, there is a point that is closer to the -axis than to the -axis. In the fourth quadrant, there is a point labeled that appears to be on the line but is farther from the origin than or .      For each of the vector fields , , and and the square centered on , , and (respectively), which statement do you think best applies?  More of the vector field is going into the square than going out.  Less of the vector field is going into the square than going out.  The same amount of the vector field is going into the square as is going out.      For each of the vector fields , , and (and corresponding square), does your answer to part suggest that the vector field is being created, destroyed, or is unchanging in strength inside the square? Explain your reasoning.    Would the answer to parts or change if you used a smaller square centered on , , and for the corresponding vector fields? Explain your reasoning.    Thinking now only about the vector field , would your answers to parts , , or change if you considered squares around points , , or ? Explain your reasoning.      Definition of the Divergence of a Vector Field    The divergence of a vector field  is given by In three dimensions, the divergence of the vector field is given by      Alternative Notation for Divergence  In other sources you may see the divergence written using a dot product as . This notation is very compact and works well with the understanding that the del operator is a function that operates on other functions. However, this notation can also be confusing because of its emphasis on computation rather than conceptual understanding. In this text, we will not generally write the divergence using the del operator.   The divergence of a vector field is a scalar measurement at a point that measures how the strength of the vectof field is changing as we look small neighborhoods around our point. While will show the details for how the divergence is defined, we can make the following qualitative argument: If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point , then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. We make this measurement of changing strength of the vector field by measureing how much of a vector field flows into versus out of a small neighborhood of our point (as was done in ). When looking at a small neighborhood of the point (as shown by the square in ), only the change of the horizontal component of the vector field contributes to flow in or out on the sides and only the change in the vertical component contributes to flow in or our on the top and bottom.   Let . Then . From our conceptual description above, being positive means that our vector field is increasing in strength. Since the divergence of does not have a dependence on the input point, that means the vector field is increasing in strength, regardless of which point we consider. In the interactive element below, you can change the point you would like plotted and the size of the region around the point. You should see that regardless of what point you select or how small you make the region around the point, there will be more of the vector field flowing out of the region than in.   An interactive plot of with point and region plotted      Let . Then . From our conceptual description above, being zero means that our vector field is not changing in strength. Since the divergence of does not have a dependence on the input point, that means the vector field is not changing in strength, regardless of which point we consider.  In the interactive element below, you can change the point you would like plotted and the size of the region around the point. You should see that regardless of what point you select or how small you make the region around the point, there will be exactly as much of the vector field flowing into the region as is flowing out (on the other side).

For instance, will be at the point . This means that for a small region around there should be more of the vector field flowing into the region than out of it. Use the interactive element below to verify this.   An interactive plot of with point and region plotted    The divergence of at the point will be zero. If you look at this point in , you will see that there is exactly as much of the vector field flowing into the region around as is flowing out.  The divergence of at the point is . This should mean that there is more of the vector field flowing into the region around than is flowing out. You should be able to see how difference regions of the -plane will have different values for .   Another way to see divergence on a vector field plot is to look at what happens to the magnitude of vectors as you move along the flow of the vector field. If the vector field is increasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is positive. If the vector field is decreasing in magnitude as you move along the flow of a vector field, then the divergence is negative. If the vector field does not change in magnitude as you move along the flow of the vector field, then the divergence is zero. Also, remember that the divergence of a vector field is often a variable quantity and will change depending on location. The next activity asks you to graphically examine the divergence of three vector fields.   Graphical Representations of Divergence   For this part of the activity, consider the vector field shown in .   Vector field   A vector field with vectors pointing toward the origin. Vectors get longer as distance from the origin increases.     Draw a circle in the first quadrant of the vector field depicted in . Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of the circle, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in the first quadrant?   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the first quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude?   Draw a circle in each of quadrants II, II, and IV. Based on the flow of the vector field into or out of your circles, do you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in quadrants II, II, and IV?   As you move along the flow of the vector field in the third quadrant of , does your vector field increase in magnitude, decrease in magnitude, or have constant magnitude.   Based on your arguments above, describe why the divergence of is negative for all points in the -plane.    Look at the plot of the vector field in and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane. You may need to make separate arguments for each of the four quadrants.   Vector field   A vector field in which vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases. Vectors are oriented as if they follow hyperbolas with asymptotes and . Vectors above both asymptotes or below both asymptotes result in counterclockwise rotation. The other vectors result in clockwise rotation.      Look at the plot of the vector field in below and state whether you think the vector field is increasing in strength, decreasing in strength, or not changing in overall strength in each of the four quadrants. You can make your argument in terms of the change in magnitude along the flow of the vector field or in terms of the net flow into or out of a small region on the plane. You may need to make separate arguments for each of the four quadrants.   Vector field    A vector field having longer vectors where . For , vectors appear to get longer as distance from the -axis increases.      The next activity of this section asks you to do some algebraic calculations of divergence using .    Calculate the divergence of the vector fields given below.            Explain how your answers to the questions in can be explained by using your results from part of this activity.      Measuring the Change in Strength of a Vector Field  In this section, we will go through the details for how to measure the density of the creation or destruction of the vector field in a classic calculus fashion. Specifically, we will measure how the strength of the vector field changes in a region around a point. Next, using a limit, we examine what happens to our measurement as we shrink the region. Because vector fields change in a continuous fashion, the vector fields don't actually change at a single point . Rather, we will measure the density for the change in strength of the vector field.  We will develop all of our measurements in a two dimensional setting for now. However, our arguments can be applied to three (or more) dimensions. We start in the same fashion as in . Namely, we will look at how much of the vector field is going into or out of a square centered at a point . For this development, we will consider a two-dimensional vector field given by .   A square around the point   A square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and centered at the point . The upper-right corner of the square is labeled .    We can parametrize the top edge of the box (in blue) by with . Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized by       all of which use the parameter values in .  The amount of the vector field that is created inside the square around the point can be measured by the net amount of the vector field coming in or going out of the square. The amount of vector flow that goes through each of the boundary segments can be measured by looking at just the orthogonal component of the vector field on each particular segment. For instance, on the top segment (in blue), the vertical component determines how much of the vector field goes in or out of the square. Integrating just the vertical component of the vector field over the points on the top segment of our square will therefore measure how much of the vector field goes through the top of the square.  The same argument applies to the bottom edge of our square (in orange). Similarly, if we want to measure how much of goes through either the left or right side of the square, we need to integrate the horizontal component . Hence, the net flow of the vector field into or out of the square will be given by  Notice that the integrals corresponding to the left and bottom segments are subtracted because we need to pay attention to the orientation of the vector field relative to the square. A positive vertical component of the vector field ( ) will correspond to flow out on the top of the square but will correspond to the vector field flowing into the square on the bottom. In the integrals above, we are counting the flow out of the square as positive and the flow in as negative.  We are measuring the net flow through the square as a scalar quantity. By decreasing , we can look at what happens to our amount of flow out of the square as we shrink to the point . In order for this to make sense across different size of squares, we will change what we are measuring to be a density argument by calculating flow in (or out) per unit area. This will allow us to compare our net flow calculations across squares with different areas. In other words, we want to consider what happens to as goes to zero.  Before we apply our limit, we will take a moment to simplify our integrals in order to make the limit easier to evaluate. In particular, we will apply the Mean Value Theorem to each of four the integrals above. Applying the Mean Value Theorem to the first integral gives , where is some value in the interval . Applying the Mean Value Theorem to each of the other integrals yields where are values in and are values in . Thus our flow density can be measured by looking at the limit as of the net flow (in or out) over the square divided by the area of the square.   To simplify the limit further, we will reorganize our limit expression. Specifically, we collect the and terms separately. This gives Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from Section 1.5.2 and as , the numbers must go to and must go to . Therefore, after evaluating our limit, the flow density is .  While this simplification may seem a bit amazing and magical, our conceptual steps should help us make sense of the result. If we are looking at how the strength of the vector field is changing in a small neighborhood of the point then we only need to look how fast the horizontal component is changing horizontally and how the vertical component is changing vertically. How the horizontal component changes over small steps in the vertical direction will give us information about how the direction of the vector field changes but not how the strength of the vector field is changing.  The arguments we made about measuring how much of the vector field flows into or out of a square has straightforward generalization to three (or more) dimensions. However, doing so requires a method for measuring how much of a vector field flows through a surface. This will be the subject of .    Summary     The divergence of a vector field is computed as In three dimensions, the divergence of the vector field is computed as     The divergence of a vector field measures the density of change in the strength of the vector field. In other words, the divergence measures the instantaneous rate of change in the strength of the vector field along the direction of flow.    The accumulation of the divergence over a region of space will measure the net amount of the vector field that exits (versus enters) the region.   The key ideas when interpreting divergence are:  A positive divergence means that the vector field is growing in strength.  A negative divergence means that the vector field is decreasing in strength.  A zero divergence means that the vector field is not changing in strength.          Let . Find the change in between and in two ways.  (a) First, find the change by computing the line integral , where is a curve connecting and .  The simplest curve is the line segment joining these points. Parameterize it:  with ,    So that    Note that this isn't a very pleasant integral to evaluate by hand (though we could easily find a numerical estimate for it). It's easier to find as the sum , where is the line segment from to and is the line segment from to . Calculate these integrals to find the change in .      So that the change in   (b) By computing values of . To do this,  First find   Thus   and  ,  and the change in is .                                                     (a) The parameterization is . Then , so that  As noted, it's simpler to integrate on the pair of line segments from to and from to . Parameterizing these in a manner similar to our parameterization of , on we have and on  . Then and so that the change in is . (b) The other way to find the change in between these two points is to first find . To do this, observe that  So one possibility for is . Thus,         Consider the vector field .  a) Find a function such that and .    b) Suppose C is any curve from to Use part a) to compute the line integral .                   Determine whether the divergence of each vector field (in green) at the indicated point (in blue) is positive, negative, or zero.          ?  Positive  Zero  Negative    ?  Positive  Zero  Negative    ?  Positive  Zero  Negative     (Click on a graph to enlarge it)   SOLUTION  If we draw a small circle around the point we can see that the flow rate out is smaller than the flow rate in (the vectors exiting the circle are shorter than the vectors entering the circle). Thus the divergence is negative.  If we draw a small circle around the point we can see that the flow rate out is larger than the flow rate in (the vectors exiting the circle are longer than the vectors entering the circle). Thus the divergence is positive.  If we draw a small circle around the point we can see that the flow rate out equals the flow rate in. Thus the divergence is zero. The vector field is incompressible at the point P.         Find the divergence of each of the following vector fields at all points where they are defined.  (a)   (b)   (c)                          Let and let Show that . Vector fields with a zero divergence everywhere in their domain are called divergence-free vector fields.   Which of the following vector fields are divergence-free?     where is a scalar function of , , and     Let . Calculate the divergence of and give a point where .  Is a divergence free vector field?       Notes to Instructors and Dependencies  This section relies heavily on understanding vector fields from .

  "body": " The Curl of a Vector Field     What is meant by rotation of a vector field in a plane?    How can a two-dimensional measurement of rotation be generalized to work in three dimensions?    How can the rotational strength of a vector field be measured?      In , we examined how the strength of a vector field in two (or more) dimensions changed in different regions. In particular, we developed the divergence of a vector field as a local (or density) measurement for how the strength of the vector field changes. The key ideas when interpreting divergence are:  A positive divergence means that the vector field is growing in strength.  A negative divergence means that the vector field is decreasing in strength.  A zero divergence means that the vector field is not changing in strength.    In many physical settings, it is also useful to measure the rotational strength of a vector field at a local scale. For instance, the vector field on the left of Figure shows a vector field which flows in a counterclockwise fashion around the origin. The vector field on the right of Figure shows a vector field which does not have a rotational aspect to its flow.   Examples of vector fields with global rotation properties (left) and without rotation in either the global or local sense (right)    A vector field exhibiting counterclockwise rotation around the origin. Vectors appear to be tangent to concentric circles centered at the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.    A vector field with all vectors pointing toward the origin. Vector magnitude increases as distance from the origin increases.     These global ideas of rotation are nice, but are not always visually apparent or may only appear in some regions. For instance, the vector field on the left of seems to have rotation around at least a couple of different points. In each quadrant, the vector field on the right of has different rotational patterns.   Examples of vector fields with varying rotation properties    A vector field having longer vectors where . For , vectors appear to get longer as distance from the -axis increases.    A vector field with vectors shortest along the line and longer as distance from that line increases. Vectors in the fourth quadrant point primarily in the positive -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the second quadrant point primarily in the negative -direction, although none are truly vertical. Vectors in the first and third quadrants exhibit a form of counterclockwise rotation.       We would like to understand and measure rotation of a vector field near a particular point. In order to investigate this concept, we will look at some two-dimensional vector fields and think about whether the vector field shown will rotate a small pinwheel or spinner placed at a particular location. The sort of spinner we imagine is illustrated in . It consists of a central axis with a four-bladed paddle placed at one end of the axis. We imagine that the spinner is anchored at a point and the vector field, perhaps thought of as a fluid flow or wind velocity vector field, pushes against the blades of the spinner's paddle. In this activity, we will be trying to assess how the the spinner will rotate around the black axel (as an axis of rotation).   An interactive plot of with point and region plotted    To begin our investigation of the rotation of a spinner in a vector field, we will look at the vector field in . As you think about these questions, draw an X at each of the points about which you are asked and consider the vector field as being the pattern of a wind blowing across the plane.   The vector field   A vector field that has only nonzero vertical component that is upward and increasing as you move horizontally to the right and downward as you move to the left.      Draw an X at the origin to act as your spinner. Draw a vector on the top right blade of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade. Next, draw a vector on each of the other blades of your spinner that represents how the wind will push on that blade.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at the origin would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all.    Now we would like to look at the rotational strength of at the point . As before, draw a spinner at this point and draw vectors on each of the blades to represent how the wind will push on that blade. It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all. You should pay attention to which blades will have a stronger force (in comparison to the blade on the other side).    Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all? Draw a representation of a spinner if necessary to demonstrate your ideas.    Are there any points on the -plane where the spinner would not turn counterclockwise?      Measuring the Circulation Density of Vector Field in  In this subsection, we will develop the measurement of the circulation density for a two-dimensional vector field. We will use this measurement to generalize to a notion of rotational strength in higher dimensional cases in the next subsection.  We will start by measuring the circulation of a vector field on a path around the point and use this measurement to define circulation density. Specifically, we will measure the circulation of a vector field as we move around a square centered at . Using this measurement, we will calculate the circulation density by dividing our measurement by the area enclosed. This will allow us to compare our measurement across regions of different sizes. By taking the limit of this circulation density as the square's side length goes to zero, we will have the circulation density at the point . Just as in our discussion of , we will look at a two dimensional setting first, then examine how our argument can be generalized to higher dimensions.  Let's start by measuring the circulation around a square with side length centered at a point . Namely, we will look at the line integral of our vector field as we move along the square curve shown in .   A square centered at the point with side lengths traveled counterclockwise   A square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The center of the square is at the point . The upper right corner of the square is labeled . Each edge of the square is oriented so that the overall orientation around the square is counterclockwise.    We can parametrize the top edge of the square using the parametrization for . Similarly, the bottom, right, and left can be parametrized (over the same range of values for ) as follows:   In order to measure the circulation around the square, we want to know how much of the vector field is parallel to the direction of travel. Thus, along each of the sides of the box, we only need to look at one of the components of the vector field. The only contribution to the circulation on the top and bottom comes from the horizontal component . Similarly, the vertical component, , is all that contributes to the circulation on the right and left sides. This means that we can simplify our line integrals considerably once we apply . For instance, the circulation on the top can be written as Similarly, we can simplify the appropriate line integrals on the other sides (ordered below as top, left, bottom, right) to get the total circulation around the square to be Note that the sign on the top and the left sides ends up being switched because the direction of travel on these sides is in the negative coordinate direction. It is important to note that by convention, we talk about positive rotation being counterclockwise and negative rotation being clockwise when looking at these planar graphs. This will be discussed more fully in .  As with our development of divergence, we apply the Mean Value Theorem to the four integrals above to simplify future calculations. Specifically, the Mean Value Theorem applied to the first integral tells us that there is a value, , in the interval such that Applying the same arguments to the other three integrals in our Total Circulation calculation gives Here we have and . We can regroup these terms to get the following expression for the total circulation around our square:   A larger square is likely to have a larger total circulation since there is more distance to accumulate how much the vector field is moving in the same direction as our path. This is why the side length of the square appears as a scalar mulitple in the formula for our total circulation. In order to compare our rotational or circulation ideas over different sizes of squares, we will now look at the circulation density (strength of rotation per unit area), which can be computed directly from our total circulation measurement. We can take the limit of the circulation density as we shrink the square to the central point and get a measurement rotational strength of our vector field at a point.  We will compute our circulation density as . Since the area of the square is , this gives us that the circulation density is . Recall the central difference method of estimating derivatives from Section 1.5.2 and notice that as , must go to and must go to . Therefore, our circulation density measurement at a point is   You may have noticed that this argument had a similar flow to the development of divergence in Section . However, the result here is different because the property of the vector field we were trying to measure was different. Because divergence was developed to measure the change in the strength of the vector field (without regard to the direction), divergence is computed using the partial derivatives of the horizontal component of the vector field with respect to the horizontal variable and the vertical component of the vector field with respect to the vertical variable. The circulation density we just developed measures how the direction of the vector field is changing, and thus uses partial derivatives of the components with respect to the transverse variable. In other words, the rotational aspects of the vector field depend on how the horizontal component of the vector field changes when we move vertically (and vice versa).  We could have used shapes other than a square in the development of the circulation density, but the square allows for calculations that are easier to understand as the area of the shape decreases.    Matching Visual Measurements to Algebraic Calculations   Remember that the circulation density of a vector field at a point is calculated as . The circulation density will be positive when a small spinner placed at will spin counterclockwise, negative when the spinner will move clockwise, and zero when the spinner does not rotate.  For each of the vector fields given below, answer the following questions:  What is the formula for the circulation density of the vector field?  For what points will you have a positive circulation density?  For what points will you have a negative circulation density?  For what points will you have a zero circulation density?                 Measuring Rotation in Three Dimensions  The previous subsection showed how we can measure the circulation density, or strength of rotation, at a point for a two-dimensional vector field. In this subsection, we will look at how this two-dimensional measurement can be used to define circulation density for three dimensional vector fields.   Rotation as a vector on the -plane    We first need to consider how we want to represent and measure rotation in three dimensions. When we developed the circulation density on the -plane, we measured the rotational strength at a point with an axis of rotation coming out of the -plane. This corresponds to the axis of rotation being given by the blue vector in . Remember that positive rotation corresponds to counterclockwise rotation in the -plane. We can generalize this idea to think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where  the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and  the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.  By convention, we consider positive rotation to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the terminal point of the vector to its initial point. In , you can see that each vector corresponds to the rotation displayed and is consistent with the conventions described above.   Rotation as a vector on each coordinate plane    If you look carefully at , you can see that the vector shown in blue will be parallel to and will represent rotations on planes of the form . Similarly, the vector shown in yellow will be parallel to and will represent rotations on planes of the form . When looking down the blue and yellow vectors (from the terminal to the initial point), you can see the positive coordinate axes as pointing to the right and up When placing the -axis horizontally for the blue vector and placing the -axis horizontally for the yellow vector (as we would expect on a two-dimensional plot). In contrast, when you look down the magenta vector (from the terminal to the initial point), the positive coordinate axes (the and axes) point to the left and up. When placing the -axis horizontally. In fact, when we look down the purple vector the -plane is flipped. A positive rotation on a plane of the form will correspond to a rotation vector that is in the direction of . This is a consequence of the right-handed coordinate system and our right-handed idea of rotation, as reflected in the relationships amongst the vectors recalled below:     By using a vector to represent the rotation of some element, we have enabled all of the tools that vectors allow, especially the ideas of projection and linear combinations. Remember that the projection of a vector onto a vector will give the vector component of that is parallel to . In other words, the projection of onto is how much of is parallel to . The projection formula will allow us to take a vector representation of rotation and determine how much rotation happens around a given axis of rotation.  Recall that we have used a set of coordinate vectors (namely , , and ) to write other vectors as a linear combination of our base vectors. In other words, a vector in can be written in the form .   The black vector, , is decomposed into parts parallel to , , and .    The linear combination of vectors will allow us to build the total rotation vector by measuring the rotational strength in the direction of three coordinate direction vectors. Just as in Figure , we will build our total rotation vector as a sum of , , and . A rotation vector in the direction of at a point will measure the circulation density at our point restricted to the trace plane . Similarly the rotation vectors in the directions and will measure the circulation density on the trace planes and , respectively.    Circulation Density in Three Dimensions  The previous subsection discussed how we can view the amount of rotation of a three-dimensional vector field in a trace plane parallel to the -, -, or -plane and recalled that vectors in can be written as a linear combination of the vectors , , and . We use our definition of curl for a two-dimensional vector field to measure the amount of rotation in the appropriate trace planes, which leads to the following definition.    Let be a three-dimensional vector field. The curl of is given by      Alternate Notation for Curl  As with divergence, there is an alternate notation for curl that uses the del operator . Specifically, for a three-dimensional vector field , .   The curl is exactly the rotational description described at the end of . When evaluated at a point , the first component of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the plane . Similarly, the second and third components of the curl will measure the circulation density of the vector field restricted to the planes and , respectively.   In this example, we will look at . So by , So . This means that will have a rotational aspect only with an axis parallel to the -axis. This should not be suprising since the plot of will be the same as copied on each plane . As you saw in , this vector field will have constant rotational strength at every point with axis of rotation in the direction.    In this example, we will look at . So by , So . Thus, will have no rotational strength anywhere. If you look at the plot of in , then you will see that dropping a spinner at any point in space will not have the spinner rotate. No matter what orientation the spinner will have, there will be equal force on each side of the spinner, thus the spinner will not rotate.   The black vector, , is decomposed into parts parallel to , , and .      In this example, we will look at . So by , So . This vector field will have a non-zero curl for every point but it will be quite difficult to see the curl at a particular point. The next activity will take you through the process of trying to visualize and understand the output of curl in 3D.    Estimating Curl in Three Dimensions   Look at the vector field plotted in . You can adjust the size of the region around over which the vector field is plotted using the Zoom slider. The Density slider allows you to adjust the number of vectors plotted. Can you see any rotation in the three dimensional vector field plot at the point ? Can you tell how a spinner placed at would rotate? Along which axis? Try to state your answer as a vector representing the rotational strength of the vector field at .   A vector field plotted in a region around the point      You likely found it difficult to decide how you thought a spinner might rotate in this new, three-dimensional setting. Let's look at the vector field in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative. Summarize your result as a vector representing the rotational strength of in the plane .   The trace of in the plane   A vector field in two dimensions. The horizontal axis is labeled and ranges from to . The vertical axis has the same range and is labeled . There is a point marked at . Vectors point primarily down and are longer when closer to the horizontal axis. In the upper-left of the plot, the vectors point more down and left. In the lower-right of the plot, vectors point more down and right.      Next we will look at the vector field in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative. Summarize your result as a vector representing the rotational strength of your vector field in the plane . Do you think the rotation in this figure is stronger or weaker than in ?   The trace of in the plane   A vector field in two dimensions. The horizontal axis is labeled and ranges from to . The vertical axis ranges from to and is labeled . There is a point marked at . Vectors in the right half of the figure are longer and point primarily up, although slightly to the left. Vectors in the left half of the figure are very short and point primarily right until around , where they start to point up but are very short.      Finally, consider the trace of in the plane , as displayed in . Do you think a spinner placed on the red point would rotate clockwise, counterclockwise, or not rotate? If the spinner will rotate, you should think about what the axis of rotation would be and whether the rotation should be positive or negative. Summarize your result as a vector representing the rotational strength of your vector field in the plane .   The trace of in the plane   A vector field in two dimensions. The horizontal axis is labeled and ranges from to . The vertical axis ranges from to and is labeled . There is a point marked at . Vectors on the left and bottom sides of the figure are slightly longer than vectors in the top and right portions of the figure. Vectors point predominantly up, although those in the lower-corner point up and left, with vectors becoming closer to upright as one moves to the upper-right corner.      Summarize your prediction to what you think the three-dimensional rotational strength of the vector field will be at the point in the form of three-dimensional vector.  Add your results from the previous three steps.   Compute the curl of . Specifically, what is at the point ?    Compare the result of the curl calculation in part to your prediction from part . You likely found it difficult to estimate the magnitude, so your answer there may be incorrect. Hopefully, you did get the signs of the components and their relative strengths (i.e., which is biggest)correct. If you did not, go back and review the previous parts and explain why the calculated components match with the rotational strength for each of the three figures.      Interpretation and Usage of Curl  The curl of a vector field is itself a vector field in that evaluating at a point gives a vector. As we saw earlier in this section, the vector output of represents the rotational strength of the vector field as a linear combination of rotational strengths (or circulation densities) from two-dimensional planar descriptions. From our description of vectors as a representation of rotations, We can think of rotation in three dimensions as being represented by a vector where  the direction of the vector represents the axis of rotation and  the magnitude of the vector represents the strength of the rotation.  By convention, we consider positive rotation to correspond to counterclockwise rotation when the vector field is viewed looking from the end of the vector to the base.  With these conventions, the output vector of the curl evaluated at a point , written as , will have the following properties:  The direction of will be the axis of rotation that has the strongest positive rotational strength.  The magnitude of will be the circulation density of the vector field in the plane through with normal vector .    The following theorem allows us to use to measure the rotational strength of around an arbitrary axis. This will be particularly useful to us in later sections.    The rotational strength of a vector field around an axis given by a unit vector at a point can be computed by .    This follows from the formula for the component of along and the fact that was selected to be a unit vector.       In this activity, we will work on calculating curl algebraically and interpreting it.    Consider the vector field . If we plot this vector field in any plane through the origin, we will see the vector field shown in . This two-dimensional vector field has no rotation. The projection of onto any direction therefore must give the zero vector. The only vector that has a zero projection in every direction is the zero vector. Verify this geometric argument for the curl of by doing the calculations necessary to show that .   The vector field on every plane through the origin   A vector field with all vectors radiating from the origin. Vector magnitudes increase as distance from the origin increases.      Now consider the vector field , which is shown in . The figure includes both an interactive three-dimensional plot of as well as a two-dimensional plot of in the yellow plane, which can be adjusted using the Angle of Plane slider.   Two views of the vector field     Based on the figure, would you estimate is positive, negative, or zero at the origin? Does your answer change if you pick a different point?   Calculate algebraically. Does the curl of this vector field vary depending on the point at which the curl is measured?   Explain why the rotational strength of the vector field on a titled plane through the origin will be given by , where is the angle between and the normal vector of the tilted plane.    In you can plot a vector field in a region around a point of your choosing in order to look at the rotational properties of the vector field. The check box in will show the curl vector at the base point specified so you can make sense of your vector field and its curl.   A plot of the vector field    Use the figure to estimate the direction of at the point . Confirm your estimate by calculating the curl at this point algebraically. Is there any point at which the direction of greatest rotational strength of this vector field has negative -component? If there is, find such a point. If not, explain why not.       Summary     The circulation of a vector field on a closed path measures how strong the vector field moves in the direction of travel for the path. The circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field is given by . The circulation density can be visualized in terms of how fast a very small spinner anchored to will rotate as a result of the force of .    By considering the circulation density of a three-dimensional vector field in planes parallel to the coordinate planes, we can calculate the curl of as .    For a three-dimensional vector field , the vector points along the axis of rotation with the greatest rotational strength at the point .

The figure below gives a sketch of a velocity vector field in the -plane. Note that vectors are given with a dot at the tail of each arrow.   (a) What is the direction of rotation of a thin twig placed at the origin along the -axis?    ?    clockwise    counterclockwise    it won't rotate    (b) What is the direction of rotation of a thin twig placed at the origin along the -axis?    ?    clockwise    counterclockwise    it won't rotate    (c) If we put a paddle wheel at the origin, instead of a twig, in what direction would you expect that to rotate?    ?    clockwise    counterclockwise    it won't rotate    (d) Compute curl .                        (a) A thin twig at the origin along the -axis would only feel the velocity perpendicular to that axis, and thus would rotate in a clockwise direction. (b) Similarly, if oriented along the -axis, rotate in a counterclockwise direction. (c) Combining (a) and (b), we expect the paddle wheel will not rotate. (d) Using the Cartesian coordinate definition, we get This is as expected, since a paddle-wheel (instead of a twig) placed in the field would behave as indicated in (c).        For each of the vector fields below, decide if they have a nonzero or zero curl at the origin. Each vector field is shown in the -plane; they have no -component and are independent of .

If the calculation of the curl is primary purpose of you using this section, then you can skip many of the details of and . The details have been made as bit sized as possible but the particulars of curl typically aren't easily understood without some of the calculations of circulation density. Additionally, the visualization of vector fields in 3D makes geometric interpretations harder to demonstrate.   "

It is important at this stage to draw the relative lengths of the vectors on each blade to scale so you can see which blades have a larger force due to the wind.    Use your vector representations from the previous part to describe if a small spinner placed at at would spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all. You should pay attention to which blades will have a stronger force (in comparison to the blade on the other side).    Would a small spinner placed at spin clockwise, counterclockwise, or not spin at all? Draw a representation of a spinner if necessary to demonstrate your ideas.    Are there any points on the -plane where the spinner would not turn counterclockwise?   "

  "body": " Green's Theorem     How can we calculate the circulation of a two-dimensional vector field around a closed curve when is not path-independent?    What is the meaning of the double integral of the circulation density of a smooth two-dimensional vector field on a region bounded by a closed curve that does not intersect itself?      We know from that a vector field is path-independent if and only if the circulation around every closed curve in its domain is . It is probably not surprising that, given the multitude of names we have for path-independent vector fields, they are important vector fields that arise frequently. However, not every vector field is path-independent, and many times we will want to calculate the circulation around a closed curve in a vector field that is not path-independent. This section explores a connection between line integrals and double integrals that you may find surprising.    We will consider the vector field , which is defined on the entire plane. Suppose that we want to calculate the circulation of around the circle of radius , centered at , and oriented counterclockwise.    Verify that is not path-independent by calculating the circulation of around the circle . The SageMath cell below is set up to assist you with this, but you will need to supply a parametrization of on line 3.      If we parametrize as , then . To use the SageMath cell to do this, make line 3 read C = vector([2*cos(t),2*sin(t)]) and execute. Because the circulation around is not , we know that is not path-independent.    Consider . In , we discussed the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field at a given point and determined that it can be algebraically determined by . Calculate the circulation density for this vector field.    No; .   Here we have that and , so we have that .    Sketch the curve and shade the region inside it. Describe the region bounded by in both rectangular and polar coordinates.   Polar: , . Rectangular: , .   Since we know the radius of is , the region the circle bounds is covered by all values of with . For , since we have the full disk, the bounds are . In rectangular coordinates, the circle is . The range for is , and solving the equation of the circle for gives us as the bounds for .    Calculate the double integral of over the region inside the circle . This integral is not the most fun to do by hand, so a SageMath cell has been provided to assist you.    If you choose polar coordinates, use for the first variable and for the second variable.     Denote by the region inside the circle . We can describe readily in polar coordinates with the inequalities and . Thus, we need to calculate . Using SageMath to calculate this, we obtain .    A natural question after completing this Preview Activity is if there is something special about the vector field or the curve that led to the results you obtained, and investigating this will be our principal task in this section      Circulation  In , you integrated the circulation density of a smooth vector field over a disk and found the result was equal to the circulation of the vector field along the region's circular boundary. This relationship is the theme of this section. To see why this would make sense, consider the region bounded by the curve shown in . We have placed a square grid inside to suggest the idea of breaking up into many smaller regions, most of which are square. This idea should make you think of the methods we have already seen of breaking up a region into smaller and smaller regions for Riemann sums.   A region bounded by a curve   A bean-shaped region in the plane that is bounded by a closed curve. The curve is oriented so that when walking along the curve, the region is always on the left. There is a square grid dividing the up the interior of the region.    The critical idea here is that if we integrate the circulation density over each of the small regions and add those up, this is the same as integrating the circulation density over the entirety of the region because of the fundamental properties of integrals. Also, integrating circulation per unit area over a two-dimensional region should be related to the total circulation on that region. Now look at and think of these four square regions as being four of the square regions inside in .   A square region divided into four smaller squares   A square region in the plane that is bounded by a closed curve oriented counterclockwise. The square is divided into four squares of equal size, which are labeled as , , , and . There are circular arrows inside each of the smaller regions indicating counterclockwise orientations.    We orient the boundary of square region in the manner suggested by the circular arrows. This means that the vertical boundary in common between and is oriented up when we calculate the line integral and oriented down when we evaluate . Thus, this line segment does not contribute to the sum . The same idea applies to the other three interior line segments so that is equal to the line integral of along the boundary of the large square.  Returning to , if we find the circulation along the boundary of each of the smaller regions, the line integrals along the boundaries that lie inside the region will all offset. Thus the value should equal . If we make our grid fine enough, all of the smaller regions into which is divided will be very close to rectangular. Our next activity looks at the relationship between the circulation along a rectangular curve with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and the double integral of the circulation density over the rectangular region inside the curve.    For this activity, we will consider the region satisfying and . The rectangular curve will be the boundary of , oriented counterclockwise. Let be a vector field that is smooth on and . We can write , where is the top edge of the rectangle and the edges are numbered counterclockwise around the rectangle.    Sketch the region and curves . Label the four corners of with the coordinates of the vertices, and be sure to indicate the proper orientation on .    Since we know that , it makes sense to parametrize each curve and write as a one-variable integral. For example, can be parametrized as with . Thus, we have . Complete this process to write the integrals for the remaining three sides as integrals with respect to or , as appropriate.       The parametrizations rely on fixing for , for , and for .     Write as the sum of two one-variable integrals (one with respect to and one with respect to ).       Because the limits of integration for the integrals match and the limits of integration for the integrals match, we can add and obtain .    We would like to see if the equality of the line integral and double integral in was a coincidence or holds for more general vector fields. (Soon we will expand our curves beyond rectangles, but for the moment, we focus on the curve and region .) To do this, we have to find some way to take our answer to the previous part of this activity, which includes two single integrals and turn them into a double integral over the rectangle .  We have assumed that is smooth on and , so the partial derivatives and are continuous functions on and . Rewrite the expression you have for in the previous step as the sum of two double integrals.   With fixed, the integrand in your integral matches what you see on the left-hand side of the Total Change Theorem , but now instead of prime notation for the derivative, you will have a partial derivative with respect to .       By the Total Change Theorem , with fixed, we have that Therefore, we have .    Rewrite your sum of two double integrals in the previous step above as a double integral over the rectangle , thereby showing that the line integral of along the curve is equal to a double integral of the region inside .       After interchanging the order of integration so that both integrals are done , the other step we must do to add them is to make the integral of have lower limit and upper limit (with respect to ). We do this by multiplying by and then can add the integrals to obtain .    Now we can see that our result in was not a coincidence and integrating the circulation density of a smooth vector field on a rectangular region gives the same result as calculating the circulation along the boundary of the region.    The phenomenon we verified for rectangular regions in is a more general result that will be the subject of our next section.    Green's Theorem  So far in this section, we have restricted ourselves to relatively nice closed curves when thinking about circulation. While the main theorem of this section will not allow us to consider arbitrary closed curves, it does cover more varied curves than we have discussed so far. A simple closed curve is a closed curve that does not cross itself, and these are the curves to which our next theorem applies.   A closed curve that is not simple  The restriction that the curve in prohibits curves such as the one below, which crosses itself.   A curve in the shape of a figure eight     Green's Theorem   Let be a simple closed curve in the plane that bounds a region with oriented in such a way that when walking along in the direction of its orientation, the region is on our left. Suppose that is vector field with continuous partial derivatives on the region and its boundary . The circulation of along may be calculated as .    In , we showed that holds when the region is a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The discussion that introduced the previous subsection may have you convinced that holds in its full form. Although our argument there was not a rigorous proof, we will not say more about why this theorem is true in full generality.   At first glance, it may seem that is of purely intellectual interest. However, we have already encountered situations where parametrization a curve can be complicated. This is particularly true when the curve has corners that require us to give separate parametrizations for several pieces of the curve, such as with the rectangular curve pictured in . However, as with this rectangle, is often the case that a curve that is difficult to parametrize bounds a region that is not too complex to describe using rectangular or polar coordinates. For instance, the rectangular region in can be described as and , rather than parametrization each of the four sides of the rectangle separately. Additionally, the integrand of the double integral in involves partial derivatives that can sometimes result in an integrand that is very easy to work with. The purpose of is, at its core, to allow you to exchange one type of integration problem (a line integral) for another type of integration problem (a double integral). This will be a recurring theme as this chapter continues.   A rectangular curve   A rectangular curve in the -plane. The lower-left corner is labeled . The upper-right corner is labeled . The curve is oriented counterclockwise.    The next activity asks you to apply .    For each of the curves described below, find the circulation of the given vector field around the curve. Do this both by calculating the line integral directly as well as by calculating the double integral from .    The curve is the circle of radius centered at the point (oriented counterclockwise) and the vector field is .     Here we find that . Therefore, the integrand in is the constant . Thus, the circulation of around is times the area of the region inside . That area is , which means that the circulation is .    The curve is the triangle with vertices , , and (oriented counterclockwise) and the vector field is .     Here we find that . The region inside can be described by and . Therefore, by , we have .    Generally, is useful for allowing us to calculate line integrals by instead calculating a double integral. Going the other direction is harder, since finding a vector field so that is equal to the integrand in the double integral can be difficult. However, the exercises will explore some situations where calculating a suitable line integral is a viable alternative to the double integral.    What happens when vector fields are not smooth?  Notice that the assumptions in require that the region be bounded by a simple closed curve and that the vector field have continuous partial derivatives on and . In , we will explore what happens when the region cannot be bounded by a simple closed curve, as sometimes multiple applications of can be used in those circumstances. Now, however, we will take a look at what happens in some cases where the vector field is not smooth.    Consider the vector field . Notice that is smooth everywhere in the plane other than at the point . This vector field is plotted in , but we have not plotted the vectors close to the origin as their magnitudes get so large that they make it hard to interpret the figure. Here applies to any simple closed curve that neither passes through nor bounds a region containing .   The vector field   A vector field with vectors tangent to circles oriented counterclockwise and centered at the origin as well as the unit circle centered at the origin and oriented counterclockwise. The vectors are longer close to the origin and shorter farther from the origin.      Find the circulation density of (i.e., the integrand of the double integral in ).   Make sure to note any exceptional points at which your formula is not valid.   for   For , we have . Thus, .    Suppose that is the unit circle centered at the origin. Without doing any calculations, what can you say about ? what does this tell you about if is path-independent?   Positive; is not path-independent   Notice that is tangent to . Thus, must be positive. (In fact, the circulation of along is the length of or because consists of unit vectors and the vector field is is tangent to .) Since there is a closed curve with nonzero circulation, is not path independent.    What would you get if you integrated the circulation density of over the region bounded by ?   The circulation density is everywhere inside except at the origin, where it is undefined. That single point does not impact the value of the double integral of the circulation density, which is thus .    Do the previous two parts contradict ? Explain your reasoning.   No.   There is no contradiction because does not apply here. The region inside the curve includes the point , and is not defined at that point. Green's Theorem requires that the vector field be smooth at every point of .    Is the vector field , which is shown in , path-independent? Why or why not?   The vector field    A vector field with vectors radiating from the origin and orthogonal to circles centered at the origin. Vectors are longest near the origin and get shorter farther from the origin.     Yes   Let . Note that , and the domain of is the same as the domain of (all of except ). Thus, is a gradient vector field and is therefore path-independent.    Suppose that is the unit circle centered at the origin. Find . Can you do this using ?   ; No   We have already shown that is path-independent, and therefore since is a closed curve. Because is not defined at the origin, does not apply to this line integral.    We can now see that is a powerful tool. However it cannot be used for all line integrals. In particular, the restriction that the vector field be smooth on the entire region bounded by a simple closed curve creates limitations. This can occur even in cases where holes in the vector field's domain or points where the vector field is not continuously differentiable lie away from .    Summary      tells us that we can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field along a simple closed curve that bounds a region in the plane on which the vector field is also smooth by calculating the double integral of the circulation density instead of the line integral.    Integrating the circulation density of a smooth vector field on a region bounded by a simple closed curve gives the same value as calculating the circulation of the vector field around the boundary of the region with suitable orientation.         Let .  The curl of  , ,  .  Is there a function such that ? (y\/n)                   n         Three small squares, and , each with side 0.01 and centered at the point , lie parallel to the -, - and -planes, respectively. The squares are oriented counterclockwise when viewed from the positive -, -, and -axes, respectively. A vector field has circulation around of , around of , and around of . Estimate curl at the point          has its component in the -direction given by  Similar reasoning leads to and Thus,         Calculate if:  (a)  is the circle oriented counterclockwise.    (b)  is the circle in the -plane oriented counterclockwise.               (a) The curve, , is closed and oriented in the correct direction for Green's Theorem. Writing for the interior of the circle, we have   (b) The circle given has radius and center . The argument in part (a) works for any circle of radius , oriented counterclockwise. So the line integral has the value .        Let and . Let be the path consisting of lines from to to to .

(b) Since by Green's Theorem,         Suppose and is the counter-clockwise oriented sector of a circle centered at the origin with radius and central angle . Use Green's theorem to calculate the circulation of around .  Circulation =   (Click on graph to enlarge)        SOLUTION  Let be the region enclosed by the curve .  First note that the curve has a positive orientation. We will use Green's Theorem. We have , therefore Hence, Green's Theorem implies         Sometimes, the value in is in converting a double integral into a line integral. Recall that the area of a region in the plane can be found by calculating .   Find a smooth vector field such that the circulation density of is everywhere.  There are several ways to choose so that .  Write out both integrals in for the vector field you selected in part .   For positive real numbers , the ellipse can be parametrized as with . Find the area of this ellipse by calculating a line integral.   Find another vector field (different from the one you found in part ) that has circulation density everywhere, and calculate the area of the ellipse in part by calculating the circulation of along the ellipse.   How many possible vector fields are there with circulation density everywhere? Why?    The types of regions in to which applies are formally called simply connected regions . To be precise, a simply connected region in is a set so that there is a path between every pair of points in that stays inside and any simple closed curve in can be shrunk to a point while remaining inside . We can think of a simply connected region as being a region that does not have any holes . There are many instances where we can find a way to apply multiple times to work with regions that are not simply connected, however.    A region that is not simply connected     Breaking up a region       Explain why the region in is not simply connected.    If we let , then the orientation of is as required by when walking along the pieces of , the region is always on the left-hand side. Assume that is a vector field that is smooth on and . Using as a guide, write as a sum of double integrals, one over and the other over .    In , we considered the vector field and found that the circulation of around the unit circle centered at the origin (oriented counterclockwise) was . Show that for every simple closed curve in the plane that bounds a region containing the origin, .     For part , create a region as in using the curve in place of .     A curve enclosing cannot be contracted to a point.   Work as in the previous part with and being the clockwise-oriented circle of radius centered at the origin with small enough that lies entirely inside .        A simple closed curve lying in the region that encloses the curve cannot be contracted to a point while remaining in the region , so this region is not simply connected.    Assume that and are oriented from bottom to top. Then . The curve in the first set of parentheses in bounds the region , and the curve in the second set of parentheses bounds the region . Since is smooth on and , applies and we have .    Let be the circle of radius , centered at the origin and oriented clockwise , with chosen to be small enough that lies entirely within . Then is exactly the type of curve considered in the previous part, as is smooth on the curves and the region they bound. Here for all points in and , so the double integrals from are . Thus, we have that . Since is tangent to everywhere, we know that .       This exercise presents another occasion where can be used to convert a double integral into a line integral.   Recall from that the centroid of a lamina of area is given by . Find vector fields and so that , where is the boundary of the lamina .    Find the centroid of the triangle with vertices , , and for real numbers .         and (other answers are possible)    and        For , we need . It works nicely to let , in which case taking gives what we need. For , we need . It works nicely to let , in which case taking gives what we need.    Using the vector fields from above, note that the line integrals along the legs of the triangle are for both and . Thus, we parametrize the hypotenuse as with . The area of the triangle is , so we find .        "

How can we calculate the amount of a vector field that flows through common surfaces, such as the graph of a function ?       showed how we can use vector valued functions of two variables to give a parametrization of a surface in space. For instance, the function with domain and parametrizes a sphere of radius centered at the origin. also gives examples of how to write parametrizations based on other geometric relationships like when one coordinate can be written as a function of the other two. In , we set up a Riemann sum based on a parametrization that would measure the surface area of our curved surfaces in space.  In , you can see a surface plotted using a parametrization . The red lines represent curves where varies and is held constant, while the yellow lines represent curves where varies and is held constant. The vector in red is which measures the direction and magnitude of change in the coordinates of the surface when just is varied. Similarly, the vector in yellow is which measures the direction and magnitude of change in the coordinates of the surface when just is varied.

Draw your vector results from on your graphs and confirm the geometric properties described in the introduction to this section. Namely, and should be tangent to the surface, while should be orthogonal to the surface (in addition to and ).    As we saw in , we can set up a Riemann sum of the areas for the parallelograms in to approximate the surface area of the region plotted by our parametrization. Equation shows that we can compute the exact surface by taking a limit of a Riemann sum which will correspond to integrating the magnitude of over the appropriate parameter bounds. What if we wanted to measure a quantity other than the surface area? In the next section, we will explore a specific case of this question: How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a surface? The geometric tools we have reviewed in this section will be very valuable, especially the vector .    The Idea of the Flux of a Vector Field through a Surface  In , we illustrate the situation that we wish to study in the remainder of this section. We have a piece of a surface, shown by using shading. There is also a vector field, perhaps representing some fluid that is flowing. We are interested in measuring the flow of the fluid through the shaded surface portion.   A three-dimensional vector field and a surface    We don't care about the vector field away from the surface, so we really would like to just examine what the output vectors for the points on our surface. So instead, we will look at .   A three-dimensional vector field evaluated along a surface    The central question we would like to consider is How can we measure the amount of a three dimensional vector field that flows through a particular section of a curved surface? , so we only need to consider the amount of the vector field that flows through the surface. Any portion of our vector field that flows along (or tangent) to the surface will not contribute to the amount that goes through the surface. In the next figure, we have split the vector field along our surface into two components. One component, plotted in green, is orthogonal to the surface. The component that is tangent to the surface is plotted in purple.   The decomposition of three-dimensional vector field evaluated along a surface into normal and tangent components    In order to measure the amount of the vector field that moves through the plotted section of the surface, we must find the accumulation of the lengths of the green vectors in . Notice that some of the green vectors are moving through the surface in a direction opposite of others. In other words, we will need to pay attention to the direction in which these vectors move through our surface and not just the magnitude of the green vectors.  If we have a parametrization of the surface, then the vector varies smoothly across our surface and gives a consistent way to describe which direction we choose as through the surface. If we define a positive flow through our surface as being consistent with the yellow vector in , then there is more positive flow (in terms of both magnitude and area) than negative flow through the surface. Thus, the net flow of the vector field through this surface is positive.   Visualizing flux through a surface   In this activity, you will compare the net flow of different vector fields through our sample surface. In you can select between five different vector fields. Once you select a vector field, the vector field for a set of points on the surface will be plotted in blue. Each blue vector will also be split into its normal component (in green) and its tangential component (in purple). The yellow vector defines the direction for positive flow through the surface.  Look at each vector field and order the vector fields from greatest flow through the surface to least flow through the surface. Remember that a negative net flow through the surface should be lower in your rankings than any positive net flow.   Five vector fields flowing through a surface, with decomposition into normal and tangential components        Measuring the Flux of a Vector Field through a Surface  Now that we have a better conceptual understanding of what we are measuring, we can set up the corresponding Riemann sum to measure the flux of a vector field through a section of a surface. Let be the section of our surface and suppose that is parametrized by with and . The domain of is a region of the -plane, which we call , and the range of is .  In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints and into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints . This divides into rectangles of size by . We index these rectangles as . Every has area (in the -plane) of . The partition of into the rectangles also partitions into corresponding pieces which we call . From (specifically ) the surface area of is approximated by .   Pieces of the tangent planes that approximate a surface    We want to measure the total flow of the vector field, , through , which we approximate on each and then sum to get the total flow. In other words, the flux of through is , where is the length of the component of orthogonal to .  For each , we approximate the surface by the tangent plane to at a corner of that partition element. This corresponds to using the planar elements in , which have surface area . The vector can be used to measure the orthogonal direction (and thus define which direction we mean by positive flow through ) on the partition element. This means that   Combining these pieces, we find that the flux through is approximated by , where . Therefore we may approximate the total flux by . Taking the limit as gives the following result.    Let a smooth surface be parametrized by over a domain . The total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .    In , you can change the number of sections in your partition and see the geometric result of refining the partition. The next activity asks you to carefully go through the process of calculating the flux of some vector fields through a cylindrical surface.   Checking the Visualization for Flux    shows a plot of the vector field and a right circular cylinder of radius and height (with open top and bottom). Consider the vector field going into the cylinder (toward the -axis) as corresponding to a positive flux.   The vector field and a right circular cylinder     Reasoning graphically, do you think the flux of throught the cylinder will be positive, negative, or zero?   Parametrize the right circular cylinder of radius , centered on the -axis for . Be sure to give bounds on your parameters.   Based on your parametrization, compute , , and . Confirm that these vectors are either orthogonal or tangent to the right circular cylinder. Is your orthogonal vector pointing in the direction of positive flux or negative flux?   Use your parametrization to write as a function of and .   The coordinate is given by the first component of .   Compute the flux of through the parametrized portion of the right circular cylinder.   Does your computed value for the flux match your prediction from earlier?   Use to make an argument about why the flux of through the right circular cylinder is zero.   The vector field with normal and tangential components plotted on a right circular cylinder      How would the results of the flux calculations be different if we used the vector field and the same right circular cylinder? Explain your reasoning.    How would the results of the flux calculations be different if we used the vector field and the same right circular cylinder? Explain your reasoning.      Efficiently Calculating Flux Integrals  In this section, we will look at some computational ideas to help us more efficiently compute the value of a flux integral. In many cases, the surface we are looking at the flux through can be written with one coordinate as a function of the others. For simplicity, we consider .   Flux Through Surfaces of the Form   In this activity, we will look at how to use a parametrization of a surface that can be described as to efficiently calculate flux integrals.    Suppose that is a surface given by . Find a parametrization of .   Use and .    Show that the vector orthogonal to the surface has the form .    For each of the three surfaces given below, compute , graph the surface, and compute for four different points of your choosing. You should make sure your vectors are orthogonal to your surface.             For each of the three surfaces in part , use your calculations and to compute the flux of each of the following vector fields through the part of the surface corresponding to the region in the -plane.   with given by   with as the triangular region of the -plane with vertices , , and   with given by     Spheres and portions of spheres are another common type of surface through which you may wish to calculate flux.   Calculating the Flux through a Sphere   For this activity, let be the sphere of radius centered at the origin.    Parametrize using spherical coordinates. Give your parametrization as , and be sure to state the bounds of your parametrization.   Use and .   Use your parametrization of to compute .  Your result for should be a scalar expression times . Explain why the outward pointing orthogonal vector on the sphere is a multiple of and what that scalar expression means.   Use your parametrization of and the results of part to calculate the flux through for each of the three following vector fields.         Use computer software to plot each of the vector fields from part and interpret the results of your flux integral calculations.  If we used the sphere of radius 4 instead of , explain how each of the flux integrals from part would change. You do not need to calculate these new flux integrals, but rather explain if the result would be different and how the result would be different.    Note that throughout this section, we have implicitly assumed that we can parametrize the surface in such a way that gives a well-defined normal vector. Technically, this means that the surface be orientable . Most reasonable surfaces are orientable. However, there are surfaces that are not orientable. Perhaps the most famous is formed by taking a long, narrow piece of paper, giving one end a half twist, and then gluing the ends together. Try doing this yourself, but before you twist and glue (or tape), poke a tiny hole through the paper on the line halfway between the long edges of your strip of paper and circle your hole. After gluing, place a pencil with its eraser end on your dot and the tip pointing away. Think of this as a potential normal vector. Keep the eraser on the paper, and follow the middle of your surface around until the first time the eraser is again on the dot. Is your pencil still pointing the same direction relative to the surface that it was before?     Summary     A flux integral of a vector field, , on a surface in space, , measures how much of goes through .    Let the smooth surface, , be parametrized by over a domain . The total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .    If is of the form over a domain , then the total flux of a smooth vector field through is given by .          Let .

(a) Find the line integral for .  line integral =  (b) For which value of is the line integral a maximum?    (Be sure you can explain why your answer gives the correct maximum.)             (a) We use Green's Theorem. Let be the region enclosed by the circle . Then  Converting to polar coordinates, we have  (b) The integrand of the integral over the disk is . Since the integrand is positive for and negative for , the integrand is positive inside the circle of radius 5 and negative outside that circle. Thus, the integral over increases with until and then decreases. The maximum value of the line integral occurs when .        (a) Show that each of the vector fields , , and are gradient vector fields on some domain (not necessarily the whole plane) by finding a potential function for each.  For , a potential function is   For , a potential function is   For , a potential function is   (b) Find the line integrals of around the curve given to be the unit circle in the -plane, centered at the origin, and traversed counterclockwise.        (c) For which of the three vector fields can Green's Theorem be used to calculate the line integral in part (b)?  It may be used for   ?    only F    only G    only H    F and G    F and H    G and H    F, G and H    (Be sure that you are able to explain why or why not.)                                      (a) We see that are all gradient vector fields, since  and Other answers are possible. (b) Parameterizing the unit circle, , by , , , we have , so The vector field is tangent to the circle, pointing in the opposite direction to the parameterization, and of length 3 everywhere. Thus The vector field points radially outward, so it is perpendicular to the circle everywhere. Thus  (c) Green's Theorem does not apply to the computation of the line integrals for and because their domains do not include the origin, which is in the interior, , of the circle. Green's Theorem does apply to .         Compute the flux of the vector field through the rectangular region shown below, assuming it is oriented as shown and that and .   flux =        . So is a normal vector and is a unit normal vector. Since this points in both the positive -direction and the positive -direction, it is cirrectly oriented for this surface. Since the area of the rectangle is , we have and .        Calculate the flux of the vector field through a square of side length in the plane . The square is centered on the y-axis, has sides parallel to the axes, and is oriented in the positive y-direction.  Flux =   .             (a) Set up a double integral for calculating the flux of the vector field through the upper hemisphere of the sphere , oriented away from the origin. If necessary, enter as rho,  as theta, and as phi.  Flux =    A =  B =  C =  D =  (b) Evaluate the integral.  Flux = =   .                                      Compute the flux of the vector field through the surface which is the cone , with , oriented downward.  (a) Parameterize the cone using cylindrical coordinates (write as theta ).        with    and    (b) With this parameterization, what is ?  =  (c) Find the flux of through .  flux =                                                is parameterized by with and . We have Since the vector points upward, in the direction opposite to the specified orientation, we use Hence      The cone is not differentiable at the point . However the flux integral, which is improper, converges.        Compute the flux of the vector field through the parameterized surface oriented upward and given, for , by  flux =        is given by Since the -component, , of the vector is positive for , we see that points upward, in the direction of the orientation of we were given. Thus, we use and so we have           Are the following statements true or false?    The area vector of a flat, oriented surface is parallel to the surface.    If is the unit sphere centered at the origin, oriented outward and the flux integral is zero, then is perpendicular to at every point of .    If is the unit sphere centered at the origin, oriented outward and the flux integral is zero, then .    If is a rectangle with area 1 and is a rectangle with area 2, then    If is the cube bounded by the six planes , , , oriented outward, and , then the flux of through is zero.    If is the unit sphere centered at the origin, oriented outward and , then the flux integral is positive.    If is an open-ended circular cylinder centered about the z-axis, oriented away from the z-axis, and , then the flux of through is zero.    If is an open-ended circular cylinder centered about the z-axis, oriented away from the z-axis, and , then the flux of through is positive.           "

How do scalar surface integrals relate to flux integrals?      In , the idea of a flux integral was introduced by looking at how much of a vector field flows through a given section of a surface in space. In particular, the flux integral measured the accumulated amount of the vector field that is orthogonal to the surface (which changes at different points on the surface.) shows the best way to calculate the flux integral in terms of a parameterization of the surface. This was an extension of the method for computing the surface area given in .  Just as we generalized line integrals of vector fields into scalar line integrals in , we will spend this section looking at the following questions:  How could we measure the accumulation of a scalar valued function along a surface in space?  What would that accmulation measure?  What is the most efficient way to calculate this?      Defining surface integrals of scalar functions  In order to create a Riemann sum that will measure the acculumation of , a scalar valued function, over . a bounded smooth surface in space, we will break our surface into smaller piecese where we can approximate the output of and the surface area of each piece. In and , we developed the way to measure surface area given a parameterization for the surface.  Suppose that is parametrized by with and . In our classic calculus style, we slice our region of interest into smaller pieces. Specifically, we slice into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints and into equally-sized subintervals with endpoints . This divides into rectangles of size by . We index these rectangles as . Every has area (in the -plane) of . The partition of into the rectangles also partitions into corresponding pieces which we call . From (specifically ) the surface area of is approximated by .   Pieces of the tangent planes used to approximate surface area    So to measure the accumulation of the output of over we use the following Riemann sum: This Riemann sum ends up being the double integral (over the variables and ) of the function , which leads to the following theorem.    Let a smooth surface be parametrized by over a domain and let be a continuous function on a neighborhood around . The acculumation of over is deonted by and is called the scalar surface integral of over . The scalar surface integral of over is computed as .      In this activity, we will try to understand the scalar surface integral by looking at whether the value of the scalar surface integral will be positive, negative, or zero over a common surfaces.

Also, if is an oriented curve, denotes the same curve but with the opposite orientation.

  "body": " Stokes' Theorem     What is the relationship between the circulation of a vector field along a simple closed curve in three-dimensional space and the flux integral of through a surface with as its boundary?    Why does the flux integral of through a surface with boundary only depend on the boundary of the surface and not the shape of the surface's interior?      When we studied in , we saw how integrating the circulation density over a region in the plane bounded by a simple closed curve gave an alternative way of calculating the circulation along the boundary curve. When we consider simple closed curves in , the situation gets more complicated. However, there is an interesting, and perhaps surprising, generalization of for us to examine.    In this activity, we will look at how we can apply the ideas about circulation along overlapping curves from the beginning of to curves in space.    For this part, consider the curves in Figure , where the yellow curve is , the blue curve is , and the magenta curve is .   Three curves in space     Write out the circulation line integrals of the closed curve consisting of the yellow curve and the and blue curve . (Remember to consider orientation!)   Write out the circulation line integrals of the closed curve consisting of the magenta curve and the blue curve . (Remember to consider orientation!)   Write out the circulation line integrals of the closed curve consisting of the yellow curve and the magenta curve .   Why does it make sense that we can add the results of the first two parts and get the third?   Would your arguments from above change at all if you considered the curves depicted in ?   Three slightly different curves in space      We will now let be the simple closed curve consisting of the yellow and magenta curves in . You can see plotted in red in . The drop-down allows you to select three different surfaces. Visually verify that each of the three surfaces contains . Notice that the scale on the -axis changes as you select different surfaces.   Surfaces containing a common simple closed curve         Circulation in three dimensions and Stokes' Theorem  In , we saw that a simple closed curve in can bound many different surfaces. For now, however, we want to focus on a smooth surface in that has a well-defined normal vector at every point and a boundary curve . We will use the normal vector to define an orientation of so that if a person were to walk along in the direction of the orientation with the top of their head pointing in the direction of , their left arm would be over the surface . Notice that this is the same convention that we used with if we assume that the normal vector being used is .  In , we show the curve from in magenta as well as a surface that has as its boundary. The chosen normal vector to is shown, as is the orientation of that matches .   A surface (and normal vector) bounded by an oriented simple closed curve    Thinking back to , our main idea was that we could calculate the circulation around a simple closed curve in by taking the double integral of the circulation density over the region bounded by the curve. As we saw in , we can break up into line integrals around other simple closed curves so that overlapping portions are oriented oppositely just as we did with the square grid for Green's Theorem. To find a three-dimensional analog of Green's Theorem, we require that a simple closed curve in three dimensions bound a smooth surface with a normal vector . In doing this, we can choose our smaller curves similar to the squares we used in Green's Theorem to lie on the surface . This gives us almost all the ingredients used in Green's Theorem, but we still need to find a suitable replacement for the circulation density.  As we saw in , the curl of a vector field in measures the rotation of the vector field. says that for a unit vector , the scalar measures the rotational strength of at the point around the axis defined by . When is the normal vector to the surface at the point , we have the appropriate analog for the circulation density of on at . Thus, the equivalent idea to integrating the circulation density of a two-dimensional vector field over a region in the plane is calculating the flux integral , where on the domain gives a parametrization of the smooth surface .  A rigorous proof of the following theorem is beyond the scope of this text. However, the previous subsection and our discussion of provide an intuitive description of why this theorem is true.   Stokes' Theorem   Let be a smooth surface in with a simple closed curve as its boundary. Let be a vector field that is smooth on and . Suppose that on the domain gives a parametrization of for which is oriented so that a person walking along in the direction of its orientation and head pointing in the direction of the normal vector would have their left hand above . In this setting, the circulation of along is equal to the flux of through . That is, .    When we looked , it was generally most useful when we were given a line integral and we calculated it using a double integral. In fact, except in the circumstances described in exercises and , we did not use Green's Theorem to rewrite a double integral as a line integral because of the difficulty of finding a suitable vector field. The situation for will be similar, with the exception of in this section. However, Stokes' Theorem gives us an interesting additional piece of freedom: selecting the surface through which we calculate the flux of from amongst possibly several reasonable surfaces with boundary . The next two activities focus on the relationships between surfaces and their boundary.    Because requires us to consider a surface (with normal vector) and the boundary of the surface, this activity will give you a chance to practice identifying the boundary of some surfaces in . For each surface below:  Describe the boundary in words.  Find a parametrization for the boundary.  Ensure that a person walking along the boundary in the direction of your parametrization with head pointing in the direction of the surface's normal vector would hold their left hand over the surface.      The surface is the portion of the sphere described below. Assume the outward orientation on the sphere.   The points with .   The points with .    The surface is the portion of the hyperbolic paraboloid with . Assume the upward orientation, e.g., the normal vector at is .    The surface is the portion of the cylinder for which , assuming the outward orientation.   It is fine for the boundary of a surface to be made up of more than one curve. Think carefully about how each piece is oriented!      In some sense, this activity considers the reverse problem of that considered in . Here, each part of the activity gives you an oriented simple closed curve in , and your task is to find  a surface so that is the boundary of and  a normal vector for the so that a person walking along in the direction of the given orientation with head pointing in the direction of your chosen normal vector would have their left hand over .  You are encouraged to think about multiple possible answers, since as we saw in , there may be more than one reasonable choice of a surface with a particular boundary.    The curve is the triangle with vertices , , and with orientation corresponding to the order the points are listed here.    The curve is the circle parametrized as for .    The curve consists of (given in order of the orientation)  the quarter-circle of radius centered at the origin in the -plane from to ,  the line segment from to ,  the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and  the line segment from to .        Verifying and Applying Stokes' Theorem  We close this section with a pair of activities. The first focuses on calculating both of the integrals in . The second asks you to calculate some line integrals along simple closed curves and gives you the discretion to choose the best method to use for this (as well as the best surface to use, if you choose Stokes' Theorem).    In this activity, we will verify by calculating both a line integral and a flux integral.    Consider the vector field and the circle parametrized as for .   Calculate directly using the given parametrization.   Let be the hemisphere of the sphere of radius centered at the origin with . Calculate the flux of through .   What could you have observed about that would have gotten you the same answer without doing either of the above calculations?    Consider the vector field and the curve , which is the triangle with vertices , , and with orientation corresponding to the order the points are listed here.   Find the circulation of along by calculating the appropriate line integrals.   The vertices of lie in a plane. Let be the portion of this plane lying in the first octant, i.e., the portion with . Find the flux of through .   Explain why the sign of your answer to the previous two parts makes sense.      Find the circulation of along the curve consisting of (given in order of the orientation) the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , the line segment from to , the quarter-circle of radius centered at in the plane from to , and the line segment from to .    Find the circulation of along the circle in the -plane of radius centered at the origin. Assume the counterclockwise orientation of the circle.    In part part of , there are two reasonable choices for the surface bounded by the circle. If you did not do so while doing the activity, we encourage you to identify both of them and compare which one makes doing the flux integral easier. In general, this will vary depending on the (curl of the) vector field in question, so we cannot give a rule for determining what surface or coordinate system to use. However, we do encourage you to think about which surface will make evaluating the flux integral easiest.    Summary      tells us that we can calculate the circulation of a smooth vector field along a simple closed curve in that bounds a surface (with normal vector) on which the vector field is also smooth by calculating the flux of the curl of the vector field through the surface.    Given two surfaces and with the same boundary (and assuming normal vectors that give the same orientation on ), the flux of through and through is the same because tells us that this flux is equal to the circulation of along .         Calculate For          : Since , we have , , hence: The domain of integration is the square in the -plane. By we get: We use the substitution to compute the integral. This gives:         Evaluate where is the helicoid: , with               Find where is a circle of radius in the plane , centered at and oriented clockwise when viewed from the origin, if          writing for the disk in the plane enclosed by the circle, Stokes' Theorem gives Now , where is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane and an area element on the plane, so , and         is generally used to turn a line integral into a flux integral. Sometimes it is possible to be given a flux integral and recognize that the given vector field is for some vector field , however. When this is the case, we call a vector potential for the vector field , much like a function so that is called a potential function for .   Find a vector field so that .   Your experience in finding potential functions for gradient vector fields will be useful to you here, although you will have more flexibility.   When finding an anti-derivative of a function of a single variable, you know that there is an infinite family of anti-derivatives, but that any two anti-derivatives differ by a constant. This is why we write expressions such as . A similar phenomenon occurs with (scalar) potential functions for gradient vector fields. Find a second vector field with the same curl as in part , and do so in a way that is not a constant vector. That is, after simplifying fully, must contain at least one of the variables .   Verify that for the vector fields you found above, is a gradient vector field. Explain why for every pair of vector potentials for a vector field , you must have that is a gradient vector field.   Explain why if is a vector field with a vector potential , . Such a vector field is called a solenoidal vector field or divergence-free vector field .    "

  "title": "The Divergence Theorem",
  "body": " The Divergence Theorem     What is a closed surface in ?    How can we efficiently calculate the flux through a closed surface in when that surface must be parametrized in several pieces?       In we examined vector fields for how the strength of a vector field changes in different regions. In particular, we developed the divergence of a vector field as a local measurement (based on density) of how the strength of the vector field changes. In particular, we did this by looking at the flux of the vector field through a closed path in two dimensions, then generalizing these ideas to higher dimensions.  In , we measured how much of a vector field flowed through a section of a surface in three dimensions as a generalization of our argument from . In this section, we will connect the ideas of flux of a vector field through a closed surface in three dimensions and the divergence of that vector field.  A surface in three dimensions is said to be closed if it has no boundary. Recalling the surfaces we studied in where we applied , none of those surfaces were closed because the boundary of the surface through which we calculated the flux was the curve along which we calculated the circulation. In , we show two surfaces that are not closed, as demonstrated by the red curves marking the edge where the surface ends.   Two surfaces that are not closed    In fact, the yellow cylinder has two edges where the surface ends (does not meet itself). The surfaces in  are closed because there is no edge to the surface. Note that the cylinder has been filled in with a cap at top and bottom (plotted in gray and green, respectively) to become a closed surface.   Two closed surfaces    Closed surfaces can be used to define the boundary of a volume in space. If we have the top and bottom on our cylinder, we have a well-defined volume of space, in that we know which points are inside the volume and which are outside of the volume. With different top and bottom surfaces, the enclosed volume would be different. illustrates three different ways to complete the cylindrical surface into a closed surface.   Three ways to close a cylindrical surface by adding a top and bottom      Measuring the Flux through a Closed Surface   Locating sources of a poisonous gas   We will use three different surfaces to examine the flux through closed surfaces. Let be the top half of the unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in magenta in the figures below). Let be the bottom half of the unit sphere centered at the origin (graphed in yellow). Finally, let be the unit disk centered at the origin in the -plane (graphed in blue). With these definitions, and will make a closed surface given by the unit sphere. The surfaces and will enclose the top half of the unit ball, while and will enclose the bottom half of the unit ball.  In this problem we will be using the surfaces defined above and the flux integrals of a poisonous gas through these surfaces to try to whether different regions of space are emitting or absorbing the poisonous gas.   In this part, we will consider the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. If the flux integral of a poisonous gas through is and the flux integral of the poison gas through is , is the interior of the sphere emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.  Unit ball with boundary given by the combination of and    In this part, we will consider the top half of the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. If the flux integral of a poisonous gas through is and the flux integral of the poison gas through is , is the top half of the unit ball emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.  Upper half of the unit ball with boundaries given by and    In this part, we will consider the bottom half of the unit ball shown in , with boundary and normal vectors as shown in the plot. Based on the information given in the previous two parts, what will the flux integrals of the poison gas be for and be in this case? Be sure to pay attention to the orientation of what we consider positive flow. Explain your reasoning.  Lower half of the unit ball with boundaries given by and    Using your answer from the previous part, is the bottom half of the unit ball emitting or absorbing poisonous gas? Explain your reasoning.   The preview activity showed how the flux through a closed surface can be subdivided into the flux through surfaces which combine to be the closed surface (with orientation switches corresponding to additive inverse). The net flux through the closed surface measures the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed on the interior of the closed surface.    The Divergence Theorem  The divergence of a vector field was developed as a measurement of the density with which the strength of vector field is changing. In three dimensions, the divergence measures the volume density in which the vector field is being created or destroyed. This means that if we integrate the divergence of a vector field over a volume of space, we will get the net amount of the vector field that is created or destroyed in that particular volume of space. Since the net amount of a vector field that is created or destroyed in a volume of space is the same as the net flux of the vector field through the boundary of that volume (which is a closed surface), we have a correspondence between a triple integral of the divergence of a vector field on the interior of a closed surface and the flux integral of the vector field over the closed surface.   Divergence Theorem   Let be a closed surface in three dimensional space and let be the volume bounded by . If is a vector field that has continuous first partial derivatives on and , then where the integral on the left measures the flux through in terms of the outward pointing normal vector.    The preview activity and the discussion before the statement of the have hopefully given you some intuition as to why the theorem is true. The ideas should also seem similar to the manner in which we approached and . The next activity walks you through evaluating both the flux integrals necessary to calculate the flux directly and the triple integral of the divergence theorem for a specific vector field and closed surface.    In this activity, we will look at calculating both sides of a non-trivial example of the . We will look at the region inside the right circular cylinder shown in . Let be the closed surface formed by combining (in yellow), (in blue), and (in magenta). The solid volume is the volume bounded by . The region shown has radius , and its height is .   A closed cylindrical surface    The vector field we consider in this activity is given by .     shows the vector field on a region around .

Be sure to give bounds for each of your parametrization.    Give inequalities in terms of cylindrical coordinates to describe .    Set up and evaluate double integrals to calculate the flux of through , , and .    What is the net flux through the closed surface? Be sure to state if the net flux is in or out.    Compute the divergence of and use this to explain whether you think will be positive, negative, or zero.    Set up and compute the triple integral for .  Use cylindrical coordinates.   Verify that your answers for part and part are the same and thus that the Divergence Theorem holds for this example.    Was the left-hand side or right-hand side of the equation in the Divergence Theorem more tedious to calculate in this example? Do you think this will be true for most other cases where the Divergence Theorem applies?    We finish this section with an activity that asks you to calculate the flux of a vector field through some closed surfaces without guiding you step-by-step.    Calculate the flux of the given vector field through the surface for each situation below.    The vector field through the tetrahedron with vertices , , , and .    The vector field through the closed portion of the sphere of radius centered at the origin having .   By itself, is not a closed surface. However, think about what additional surface you need to add to make a closed surface.      Summary     A closed surface is one that has no boundary.    The flux of a smooth vector field through a closed surface can be computed by integrating the divergence of the vector field over the volume bounded by the closed surface.         Use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate where and is the boundary of the part of the paraboloid where which lies above the xy-plane and is oriented counterclockwise when viewed from above.              Verify Stokes' theorem for the helicoid where lies in the rectangle , and is the vector field .  First, compute the surface integral:  , where  , , , , and   (use \"t\" for theta).  Finally, the value of the surface integral is .  Next compute the line integral on that part of the boundary from to .  , where  , , and   (use \"t\" for theta).                                                      Verify the Divergence Theorem for the vector field and region:  and the region ,                 With Let be the surface of the cylinder and the region enclosed by . We compute the two sides of the Divergence Theorem: We first calculate the surface integral. Step 1. Integral over the side of the cylinder. The side of the cylinder is parametrized by  Then, We obtain the integral  Step 2. Integral over the top of the cylinder. The top of the cylinder is parametrized by with parameter domain . The upward pointing normal is Also, Hence, The last integral is zero due to symmetry.  Step 3. Integral over the bottom of the cylinder. We parametrize the bottom by The downward pointing normal is . Then We obtain the following integral, which is zero due to symmetry: Adding the integrals we get  Step 4. Compare with integral of divergence.  The equality of and verifies the Divergence Theorem.
